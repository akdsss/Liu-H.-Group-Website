abstract: We systematically investigated the roles of tail length on the  self-assembly of shape amphiphiles composed of a hydrophobic polymer  chain (tail) and a hydrophilic nanoparticle in selective solvent using  Brownian dynamics simulations. The shape amphiphiles exhibited a variety  of self-assembled aggregate morphologies which can be tuned by changing  tail length (n) in combination with amphiphile concentration (φ) and  system temperature (T*). Specifically, at high φ with T*=1.4, the  morphology varied following the sequence “spheres → cylinders →  vesicles” upon increasing n, agreeing well with experimental  observations. At low φ with T*=1.4 or at high φ with T*=1.2, the  morphology sequence becomes “spheres or spheres and cylinders mixture →  cylinders → vesicles → spheres” upon increasing n, which has not been  found experimentally. Two morphological phase diagrams depending on n  and φ were constructed for T*=1.4 and 1.2, respectively. The rich phase  behaviors on varying tail length could provide the feasible routes to  fabricate target aggregate morphologies in various applications,  especially for the vesicles with tunable thickness of membranes that are  crucial in drug and gene delivery.
