The catalytic performance, depending on the surface nature, is  ubiquitous in photocatalysis. However, surface engineering for organic  photocatalysts through structural modulation has long been neglected.  Here, we propose a zone crystallization strategy for covalent organic  frameworks (COFs) that enhances surface ordering through  regulator-induced amorphous-tocrystalline transformation. Dynamic  simulations show that attaching monofunctional regulators to the surface  of spherical amorphous precursor improves surface dynamic  reversibility, increasing crystallinity from the inside out. The  resulting COF microspheres display surface-enhanced crystallinity and  uniform spherical morphology. The visible photocatalytic hydrogen  evolution rate reaches 126 mmol g–1 h–1 for the simplest  β-ketoenamine-linked COF and 350 mmol gCOF–1 h–1 for SiO2@COF with  minimal Pt cocatalysts. Mechanism studies indicate that surface  crystalline domains build the surface electrical fields to accumulate  photogenerated electrons and diminish electron transfer barriers between  the COF and Pt interface. This work bridges the gap between microscopic  molecules and macroscopic properties, allowing tailored design of  crystalline organic photocatalysts."
