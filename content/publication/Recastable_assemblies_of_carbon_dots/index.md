Assembly of nanoparticles into macroscopic materials with  mechanical robustness, green processability, and recastable ability is  an important and challenging task in materials science and  nanotechnology. As an emerging nanoparticle with superior properties,  macroscopic materials assembled from carbon dots will inherit their  properties and further offer collective properties; however, macroscopic  materials assembled from carbon dots solely remain unexplored. Here we  report macroscopic films assembled from carbon dots modified by ureido  pyrimidinone. These films show tunable fluorescence inherited from  carbon dots. More importantly, these films exhibit collective properties  including self-healing, re-castability, and superior mechanical  properties, with Young’s modulus over 490 MPa and breaking strength over  30 MPa. The macroscopic films maintain original mechanical properties  after several cycles of recasting. Through scratch healing and welding  experiments, these films show good self-healing properties under mild  conditions. Moreover, the molecular dynamics simulation reveals that the  interplay of interparticle and intraparticle hydrogen bonding controls  mechanical properties of macroscopic films. Notably, these films are  processed into diverse shapes by an eco-friendly hydrosetting method.  The methodology and results in this work shed light on the exploration  of functional macroscopic materials assembled from nanoparticles and  will accelerate innovative developments of nanomaterials in practical  applications."
