It is crucial to understand how much and how far the structure  and dynamics properties of the polymer melt can be affected by  incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) in the system. Here, we show that in  an athermal all-polymer nanocomposites prepared from mixtures of linear  polystyrene chains and cross-linked polystyrene NPs, the influence range  of the NP on the melt polymer properties, namely interphase thickness,  depends on the properties investigated. The local segment conformations  can be affected in the range of an NP radius. However, if the interphase  thickness is defined by the influence range of the NP on the radius of  gyration (Rg) of the melt chain, it can be 1.5Rg for short-chain melts  where the chain has a Rg smaller than particle radius Ra. For  intermediate chain length polymer melts (Rg > Ra), the influence  range of the NP does not change with the chain length. With the chain  length further increasing, melt chains cannot feel the existence of the  NP; the influence of the NP on the Rg tensors of the melt chain can be  negligible. For the dynamics properties, the effects caused by the NP  can be differently at different length and time scales. The mobility of  the monomers can be slowed down in the vicinity of the NP, but they can  have a faster mobility in the tangential direction than in the radial  direction of the NP surface. More importantly, the segmental relaxation  of the melt chains can be accelerated by the fast thermal deformations  of the loose NP surface structures. We demonstrate that the softness of  the NP and its deformability are crucial to the dynamics properties of  the nanocomposites."
