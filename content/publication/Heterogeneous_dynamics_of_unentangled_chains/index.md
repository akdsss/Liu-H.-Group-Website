abstract: We present a systematic investigation on the effect of adding  nanoparticles on the dynamics of polymer chains by using coarse-grained  molecular dynamics simulation. The dynamics is characterized by three  aspects:molecular motion, relaxation at different length scales, and  dynamical heterogeneity. It is found that the motion of polymer chains  slows down and the deviation from Gaussian distribution becomes more  pronounced with increasing nanoparticle volume fractions. For polymer  nanocomposites with R ≤ Rg, the relaxation at the wave vector q = 7.0  displays multistep decay, consistent with the previous reports in  strongly interacting polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, a qualitatively  universal law is established that dynamic heterogeneity at whole chain’s  scale follows a nonmonotonic increase with increasing nanoparticle  loadings, where the volume fraction of the maximum dynamic heterogeneity  corresponds to the particle loading when the average distance between  nanoparticles is equal to the Kuhn length of polymer chains. We show  that the decoupling between whole chain’s dynamics and segment dynamics  is responsible for the nonmonotonic behavior of dynamic heterogeneity of  whole chains.
