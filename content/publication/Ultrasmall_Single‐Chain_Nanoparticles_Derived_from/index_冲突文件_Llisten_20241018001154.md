abstract: The collapse or folding of an individual polymer chain into a  nanoscale particle gives rise to single‐chain nanoparticles (SCNPs),  which share a soft nature with biological protein particles. The precise  control of their properties, including morphology, internal structure,  size, and deformability, are a long‐standing and challenging pursuit.  Herein, a new strategy based on amphiphilic alternating copolymers for  producing SCNPs with ultrasmall size and uniform structure is presented.  SCNPs are obtained by folding the designed alternating copolymer in  N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF) and fixing it through a photocatalyzed  cycloaddition reaction of anthracene units. Molecular dynamics  simulation confirms the solvophilic outer corona and solvophobic inner  core structure of SCNPs. Furthermore, by adjusting the length of PEG  units, precise control over the mean size of SCNPs is achieved within  the range of 2.8 to 3.9 nm. These findings highlight a new  synthetic strategy that enables enhanced control over morphology and  internal structure while achieving ultrasmall and uniform size for  SCNPs.
