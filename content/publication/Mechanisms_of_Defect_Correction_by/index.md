Reversible chemistries have been extensively explored to  construct highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via  defect correction. However, the mechanisms of defect correction that can  explain the formation of products as single crystals,  polycrystal/crystallites, or amorphous solids remain unknown. Herein, we  employed molecular dynamics simulations combined with a polymerization  model to investigate the growth kinetics of two-dimensional COFs. By  virtue of the Arrhenius two-state model describing reversible reactions,  we figured out the conditions in terms of active energy and binding  energy for different products. Specifically, the ultraslow growth of  COFs under high reversibility of reactions corresponding to low binding  energies resulted in a single crystal by inhibiting the emergence of  nuclei as well as correcting defects through continually dropping small  defective fragments off at crystal boundaries. High bonding energies  responsible for the high nucleation rate and rapid growth that  incorporated defects in crystals and caused the division of crystals  through defect correcting processes led to small crystallites or  polycrystals. The insights into the mechanisms help us to understand and  further control the growth kinetics by exploiting reversible conditions  to synthesize COFs of higher quality."
