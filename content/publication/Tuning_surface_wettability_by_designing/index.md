abstract: "We present a molecular dynamics simulation study on the  controlling factors that influence the wettability of a hairy surface.  By adopting the hairs with appropriate grafting density, hair length,  and hair rigidity, the hairy surface shows good performance on droplet  repellency. When the droplet sits on the hairy surface, the flexible  hairs can spontaneously bundle with the appropriate amount of  neighboring hairs to enhance the surface hydrophobicity, thus providing a  new possibility to control the surface wettability. The hairy surface  with tunable grafting density and hair rigidity, bridges the gap between  surfaces with soft polymer brushes and surfaces that are completely  hard but porous."
