abstract: Polymerization of monomers into two-dimensional covalent  organic frameworks with precise porous structures exhibits desired  catalytic, gas separation, and optoelectronic properties. However, the  defects arising from covalent bonding in a polymerization process always  result in amorphous films with small crystalline domains or  polycrystalline powders. It is still a tremendous challenge to  synthesize high-quality crystalline products, even single crystals with a  large size over the micrometer scale. In this work, we propose a  general strategy of building block design to reduce the defects during  growth of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks. We demonstrate  that the building block with a hexagonal pore unit, i.e., a hexamer,  could greatly decrease defects by directional uniform growth in  polymerization, while monomer, dimer, and trimer building blocks form  more defects due to linear growth. Our work provides a new strategy to  construct superlarge single crystals in practical applications by  combining building block design and growing dynamics control.
