abstract: "Computer simulations provide a unique insight into the  microscopic details, molecular interactions and dynamic behavior  responsible for many distinct physicochemical properties of ionic  liquids. Due to the sluggish and heterogeneous dynamics and the  long-ranged nanostructured nature of ionic liquids, coarse-grained  meso-scale simulations provide an indispensable complement to detailed  first-principles calculations and atomistic simulations allowing studies  over extended length and time scales with a modest computational cost.  Here, we present extensive coarse-grained simulations on a series of  ionic liquids of the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (alkyl = butyl,  heptyl-, and decyl-) family with Cl, [BF4], and [PF6] counterions.  Liquid densities, microstructures, translational diffusion coefficients,  and re-orientational motion of these model ionic liquid systems have  been systematically studied over a wide temperature range. The addition  of neutral beads in cationic models leads to a transition of liquid  morphologies from dispersed apolar beads in a polar framework to that  characterized by bi-continuous sponge-like interpenetrating networks in  liquid matrices. Translational diffusion coefficients of both cations  and anions decrease upon lengthening of the neutral chains in the  cationic models and by enlarging molecular sizes of the anionic groups.  Similar features are observed in re-orientational motion and time scales  of different cationic models within the studied temperature range. The  comparison of the liquid properties of the ionic systems with their  neutral counterparts indicates that the distinctive microstructures and  dynamical quantities of the model ionic liquid systems are intrinsically  related to Coulombic interactions. Finally, we compared the  computational efficiencies of three linearly scaling O(N log N) Ewald  summation methods, the particle–particle particle–mesh method, the  particle–mesh Ewald summation method, and the Ewald summation method  based on a non-uniform fast Fourier transform technique, to calculate  electrostatic interactions. Coarse-grained simulations were performed  using the GALAMOST and the GROMACS packages and hardware efficiently  utilizing graphics processing units on a set of extended  [1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium][BF4] ionic liquid systems of up to 131 072  ion pairs."
