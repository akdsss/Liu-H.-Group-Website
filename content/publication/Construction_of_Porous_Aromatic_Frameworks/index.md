abstract: "The construction of excellent porous organic frameworks (POFs)  with high surface areas and stability is always a tremendous challenge  in synthetic chemistry. The geometric configuration and reactive group  of building unit are crucial factors to influence the structure and  porosity of the resulting product. Herein, the design, synthesis, and  characterization of two porous aromatic framework (PAF) materials, named  PAF-100 and PAF-101, are reported via a strategy of building unit  engineering. PAF-100 and PAF-101 present high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller  surface areas exceeding 5000 m2 g−1 and uniform pore size distributions.  Furthermore, PAF-100 and PAF-101 show high methane uptake with value of  742 and 622 cm3 g−1, respectively, at 298 K and 70 bar. The successful  synthesis of PAFs with exceptional porosity from engineered building  unit is powerful for constructing highly porous POFs."
