abstract: All-polymer solar cells (APSCs), composed of semiconducting  donor and acceptor polymers, have attracted considerable attention due  to their unique advantages compared to polymer-fullerene-based devices  in terms of enhanced light absorption and morphological stability. To  improve the performance of APSCs, the morphology of the active layer  must be optimized. By employing a random copolymerization strategy to  control the regularity of the backbone of the donor polymers (PTAZ-TPDx)  and acceptor polymers (PNDI-Tx) the morphology can be systematically  optimized by tuning the polymer packing and crystallinity. To minimize  effects of molecular weight, both donor and acceptor polymers have  number-average molecular weights in narrow ranges. Experimental and  coarse-grained modeling results disclose that systematic backbone  engineering greatly affects the polymer crystallinity and ultimately the  phase separation and morphology of the all-polymer blends. Decreasing  the backbone regularity of either the donor or the acceptor polymer  reduces the local crystallinity of the individual phase in blend films,  affording reduced short-circuit current densities and fill factors. This  two-dimensional crystallinity optimization strategy locates a PCE  maximum at highest crystallinity for both donor and acceptor polymers.  Overall, this study demonstrates that proper control of both donor and  acceptor polymer crystallinity simultaneously is essential to optimize  APSC performance.
