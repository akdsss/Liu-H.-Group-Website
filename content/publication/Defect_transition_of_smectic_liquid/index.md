abstract: "The formation and transformation of defects in confined liquid  crystals are fascinating fundamental problems in soft matter. Here, we  use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study ellipsoidal liquid  crystals (LCs) confined in a spherical cavity, which significantly  affects the orientation and translation of LC molecules near the  surface. The liquid-crystal droplet can present the isotropic to  smectic-B phase transition through the smectic-A phase, as the number  density of the LC molecules increases. We further find the change of LC  structure from bipolar to watermelon-striped during the phase transition  from smectic-A (SmA) to smectic-B (SmB) phases. Our results reveal the  transition from bipolar defects to the inhomogeneous structures with the  coexistence of nematic and smectic phases in smectic liquid-crystal  droplets. We also study the influence of the sphere size in the range of  10σ0 ≤ Rsphere ≤ 50σ0 on the structural inhomogeneities. It shows a  weak dependence on the sphere size. We further focus on how the  structures can be affected by the interaction strength εGB–LJ.  Interestingly, we find the watermelon-striped structure can be changed  into a configuration with four defects at the vertices of a tetrahedron  upon increasing the interaction strength. The liquid crystals at a  strong interaction strength of εGB–LJ = 10.0ε0 show the two-dimensional  nematic phase at the surface. We further present an explanation for the  origin of the striped-pattern formation. Our results highlight the  potential for using confinement to control these defects and their  associated nanostructural heterogeneity."
