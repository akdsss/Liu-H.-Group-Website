We study the self-assembly of symmetric star-like block  copolymers (Ax)y(Bx)yC in dilute solution by using Brownian dynamics  simulations. In the star-like block copolymer, incompatible A and B  components are both solvophobic, and connected to the center bead C of  the polymer. Therefore, this star-like block copolymer can be taken as a  representative of soft and deformable Janus particles. In our Brownian  dynamics simulations, these “soft Janus particles” are found to  self-assemble into worm-like lamellar structures, loose aggregates and  so on. By systematically varying solvent conditions and temperature, we  build up the phase diagram to illustrate the effects of polymer  structure and temperature on the aggregate structures. At lower  temperatures, we can observe large worm-like lamellar aggregates. Upon  increasing the temperature, some block copolymers detach from the  aggregate; this phenomenon is especially sensitive for the polymers with  less arms. The aggregate structure will be quite disordered when the  temperature is high. The incompatibility between the two parts in the  star-like block copolymer also affects the self-assembled structures. We  find that the worm-like structure is longer and narrower as the  incompatibility between the two parts is stronger."
