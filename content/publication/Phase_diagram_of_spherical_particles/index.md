abstract: "We construct the phase diagram of spherical particles  interacted with harmonic repulsions, which are ultrasoft and bounded at  fully overlapping. This simple potential form can be used for describing  the thermodynamic properties and dynamic behavior of interpenetrable  globular micelles, microgels, starlike polymer solutions, and so on.  Using dissipative particle dynamics simulations combined with  thermodynamic integration, we compute chemical potentials of fluid phase  and a number of crystal structures. In addition to the face-centered  cubic and body-centered cubic structures, we also find the tetragonal,  hexagonal, orthorhombic, and diamond crystal structures stable for this  system. In the phase diagram, we identify multiple re-entrant melting  regions and polymorphic transitions between the crystals."
