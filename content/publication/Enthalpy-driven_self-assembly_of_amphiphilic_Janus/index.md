abstract: Synthetic vesicles of amphiphilic Janus dendrimers are known  as dendrimersomes. The understanding of the conditions and formation  mechanism of dendrimersomes is meaningful for further controlling the  structures. Herein, the characteristics of the self-assembly of  amphiphilic Janus dendrimer/water solutions into unilamellar and  onion-like dendrimersomes are studied by molecular dynamics simulations  via a spherical single-site Janus particle model. The model with two  distinct surfaces, one hydrophobic side and another hydrophilic side,  describes the amphiphilic nature of Janus dendrimers. By reducing the  dendrimers with complex architectures to be simple Janus particles, we  investigate the concentration-dependent self-assembled structures as  well as the enthalpy-driven formation process of onion-like  dendrimersomes, in contrast to the entropy-mediated self-assembly of  amphiphilic flexible chains. Three typical equilibrium morphologies  including linear micelles, lamellar structures and vesicles are found  upon varying the Janus balance and dendrimer concentration. It is  observed that the dendrimersomes consisting of the dendrimers with  neglectable molecular configuration entropy become very stable, which  agrees well with experimental observation. Specifically, different from  many lipidsomes and polymersomes which can spontaneously merge, the size  of dendrimersomes will not increase through mutual fusion once the  well-defined onion-like structure is formed. Moreover, the discharge of  water is achieved by water diffusion in our simulations, instead of in  the “peeling-one-onion-layer-at-a-time” fashion. Our study combined with  the previous ones using flexible chain models could depict a complete  picture of dendrimersomes in favor of their applications in drug and  gene delivery.
