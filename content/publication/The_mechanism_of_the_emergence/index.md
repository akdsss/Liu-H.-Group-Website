abstract: "Although multiple overstretched DNA states were identified in  experiments, the mechanism of the emergence of distinct states is still  unclear. Molecular dynamics simulation is an ideal tool to clarify the  mechanism, but the force loading rates in stretching achieved by  conventional all-atom DNA models are much faster, which essentially  affect overstretching states. We employed a modified coarse-grained DNA  model with an unprecedented low loading rate in simulations to study the  overstretching transitions of end-opened double-stranded DNA. We  observed two-strand peeling off for DNA with low stability and the S-DNA  with high stability under tension. By introducing a melting-forbidden  model which prevents base-pair breaking, we still observed the  overstretching transition induced by the formation of S-DNA due to the  change of dihedral angle. Hence, we confirmed that the competition  between the two strain-softening manners, i.e., base-pair breaking and  dihedral angle variation, results in the emergence of distinct  overstretched DNA states."
