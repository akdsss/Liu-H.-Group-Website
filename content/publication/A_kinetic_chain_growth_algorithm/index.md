abstract: We propose a kinetic chain growth algorithm for coarse-grained  (CG) simulations in this work. By defining the reaction probability, it  delivers a description of consecutive polymerization process. This  algorithm is validated by modeling the process of individual styrene  monomers polymerizing into polystyrene chains, which is proved to  correctly reproduce the properties of polymers in experiments. By  bridging the relationship between the generic chain growth process in CG  simulations and the chemical details, the impediment to reaction can be  reflected. Regarding to the kinetics, it models a polymerization  process with an Arrhenius-type reaction rate coefficient. Moreover, this  algorithm can model both the gradual and jump processes of the bond  formation, thus it readily encompasses several kinds of previous CG  models of chain growth. With conducting smooth simulations, this  algorithm can be potentially applied to describe the variable  macroscopic features of polymers with the process of polymerization. The  algorithm details and techniques are introduced in this article. © 2016  Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
