abstract: We numerically investigate the connection between spatial  density correlation and dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming  liquids. We demonstrate that the cluster size defined by the spatial  aggregation of densely packed particles (DPPs) can better capture the  difference between the dynamics of the Lennard-Jones glass model and the  Weeks-Chandler-Andersen truncation model than the commonly used pair  correlation functions. More interestingly, we compare the mobility of  DPPs and loosely packed particles, and we find that high local density  correlates well with slow dynamics in systems with relatively hard  repulsive interactions but links to mobile ones in the system with soft  repulsive interactions at one relaxation time scale. Our results show  clear evidence that the above model dependence behavior stems from the  hopping motion of DPPs at the end of the caging stage due to the  compressive nature of soft repulsive spheres, which activates the  dynamics of DPPs in the α relaxation stage.
