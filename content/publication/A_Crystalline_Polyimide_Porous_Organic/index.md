abstract: "The separation of acetylene from ethylene is a crucial process  in the petrochemical industry, as even small acetylene impurities can  lead to premature termination of ethylene polymerization. Herein, we  present the synthesis of a robust, crystalline naphthalene diimide  porous aromatic framework via imidization of linear  naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and triangular  tris(4-aminophenyl)amine. The resulting material, PAF-110, exhibits  impressive thermal and long-term structural stability, as indicated by  thermogravimetric analysis and powder X-ray diffraction  characterization. Gas adsorption characterization reveals that PAF-110  has a capacity for acetylene that is more than twice its ethylene  capacity at 273 K and 1 bar, and it exhibits a moderate acetylene  selectivity of 3.9 at 298 K and 1 bar. Complementary computational  investigation of each guest binding in PAF-110 suggests that this  affinity and selectivity for acetylene arises from its stronger  electrostatic interaction with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the  framework. To the best of our knowledge, PAF-110 is the first  crystalline porous organic material to exhibit selective adsorption of  acetylene over ethylene, and its properties may provide insight into the  further optimized design of porous organic materials for this key gas  separation."
