abstract: Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which  has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and  good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and  recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at  break (1.21 GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2 MJ m−3), which are,  respectively, comparable to and ≈2.4 times higher than those of typical  spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile  strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6 MPa) ever recorded for  polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable  elastomer thus far. The hyper-robust elastomer exhibits superb crack  tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2 kJ m−2) that  even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic  restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12  times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from  the meticulously engineered hydrogen-bonding segments, consisting of  multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible  alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen-bonding segments,  incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form  geometrically confined hydrogen-bond arrays resembling those in spider  silk. The hydrogen-bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and  sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring  exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the  elastomer.
