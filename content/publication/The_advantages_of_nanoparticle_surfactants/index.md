The nanoparticle (NP) surfactants generated in situ by binding  NPs and polymers can assemble into an elastic NP monolayer at the  interface of two immiscible liquids, structuring the liquids. Janus NPs  can be more strongly bound to the interface than the NP surfactants, but  they are unable to structure liquids into complex shapes due to the  difficulty of assembling the jamming arrays. By molecular dynamics  simulations, we give an insight into the better performance of NP  surfactants than Janus NPs on dynamically structuring liquids. The high  energy binding of Janus NPs to the interface will drive the Janus NPs to  assemble into micelles in binary liquids. The micelles are stabilized  in one liquid by encapsulating a little of the other liquid, hindering  interfacial adsorption when the interface is marginally extended upon  liquid deformation. In contrast, the in situ formed NP surfactants can  rapidly fill the enlarged interfacial area to arrest the consecutive  shape changes of the liquids. Moreover, NP surfactants can be designed  with an appropriate coverage ratio (≤50%) of NP surface bearing  host–guest sites to avoid dissolution and impart a desirable mechanical  elasticity to their assembly."
