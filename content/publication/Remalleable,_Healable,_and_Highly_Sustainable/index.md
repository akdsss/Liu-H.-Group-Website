abstract: To build a sustainable society, it is of significant  importance but highly challenging to develop remalleable, healable, and  biodegradable polymeric materials with integrated high strength and high  toughness. Here, we report a superstrong and ultratough sustainable  supramolecular polymeric material with a toughness of ca. 282.3 J g–1  (395.2 MJ m–3) in combination with a tensile strength as high as ca.  104.2 MPa and a Young’s modulus of ca. 3.53 GPa. The toughness is even  higher than that of the toughest spider silk (ca. 354 MJ m–3) ever found  in the world, while the material also exhibits a superior tensile  strength over most engineering plastics. This material is fabricated by  topological confinement of the biodegradable linear polymer of  poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via the naturally occurring dendritic  molecules of tannic acid (TA) based on high-density hydrogen bonds.  Simply blending TA and PVA in aqueous solutions at acidic conditions  leads to the formation of TA–PVA complexes as precipitates, which can be  processed into dry TA–PVA composite products with desired shapes via  the compression molding method. Compared to the conventional solution  casting method for the fabrication of PVA-based thin films, the  as-developed strategy allows large-scale production of bulk TA–PVA  composites. The TA–PVA composites consist of interpenetrating  three-dimensional supramolecular TA–PVA clusters. Such a structural  feature, revealed by computational simulations, is crucial for the  integrated superhigh strength and ultrahigh toughness of the material.  The biodegradable TA–PVA composites are remalleable for multiple  generations of recycling and healable after break, at room temperature,  by the assistance of water to activate the reversibility of the hydrogen  bonds. The TA–PVA composites show high promise as sustainable  substitutes for conventional plastics because of their remalleability,  healability, and biodegradability. The integrated superhigh strength and  ultrahigh toughness of the TA–PVA composites ensure their high  reliability and broad applicability.
