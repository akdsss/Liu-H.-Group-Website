abstract: "Ensuring effective and controlled zinc ion transportation is  crucial for functionality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and  overall performance in zinc‐based battery systems. Herein the first‐ever  demonstration of incorporate cation‐π interactions are provided in the  SEI to effectively facilitate uniform zinc ion flux. The artificial SEI  design involves the immobilization of 4‐amino‐p‐terphenyl (TPA), a  strong amphiphilic cation‐π interaction donor, as a monolayer onto a  conductive poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) matrix, which enable  the establishment of a robust network of cation‐π interactions. Through  a carefully‐designed interfacial polymerization process, a  high‐quality, large‐area, robust is achieved, thin polymeric TPA/PEDOT  (TP) film for the use of artificial SEI. Consequently, this interphase  exhibits exceptional cycling stability with low overpotential and  enables high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping. Symmetrical cells  with TP/Zn electrodes can be cycled for more than 3200 hours at  1 mA cm               −2               and 1 mAh cm               −2               . And the asymmetric cells can cycle 3000 cycles stably  with a high Coulomb efficiency of 99.78%. Also, under the extreme  conditions of lean electrolyte and low N/P ratio, the battery with TP  protective layer can still achieve ultra‐stable cycle."
