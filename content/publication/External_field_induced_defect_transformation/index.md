Normally, defects in two-dimensional, circular, confined  liquid crystals can be classified into four types based on the position  of singularities formed by liquid crystal molecules, i.e., the  singularities located inside the circle, at the boundary, outside the  circle, and outside the circle at infinity. However, it is considered  difficult for small aspect ratio liquid crystals to generate all these  four types of defects. In this study, we use molecular dynamics  simulation to investigate the defect formed in Gay–Berne, ellipsoidal  liquid crystals, with small aspect ratios confined in a circular cavity.  As expected, we only find two types of defects (inside the circle and  at the boundary) in circular, confined, Gay–Berne ellipsoids under  static conditions at various densities, aspect ratios, and interactions  between the wall and liquid crystals. However, when introducing an  external field to the system, four types of defects can be observed.  With increasing the strength of the external field, the singularities in  the circular, confined system change from the inside to the boundary  and the outside, and the farthest position that the singularities can  reach depends on the strength of the external field. We further  introduce an alternating, triangular wave, external field to the system  to check if we can observe the transformation of different defects  within an oscillating period. We find that the position of the  singularities greatly depends on the oscillating intensity and  oscillating period. By changing the oscillating intensity and  oscillating period of the external field, the defect types can be  adjusted, and the transformation between different defects can be easily  observed. This provides a feasible way to modulate liquid crystal  defects and investigate the transformation between different defects."
