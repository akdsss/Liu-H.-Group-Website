abstract: "We investigate numerically the relaxation and diffusion  dynamics in three-dimensional Kob-Andersen glass-forming liquids in  which part of the particles are randomly chosen and pinned permanently.  We find that both the relaxation dynamics and diffusion dynamics slow  down as increasing the pinning concentration (cpin) at fixed  temperatures that we study. For higher temperature and lower cpin, the α  relaxation time τ and the diffusion coefficient D have the scaling  relationship D ∼ τ−1. However, this coupling behavior breaks down if  cpin is further increased, and the scaling relationship is replaced by D  ∼ τ−ν with ν &lt; 1. At temperatures around the onset temperature  of the bulk system, a transition from ν ∼ 0.75 to ν ∼ 0.61 with  increasing cpin is found. However, at lower temperatures, ν ∼ 0.67 holds  in the whole studied cpin range. By fitting the relaxation time as a  function of cpin with Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, we find that the  change of scaling exponent ν is accompanied with the change of fragility  parameter K at higher temperatures. However, at lower temperatures,  pinning particles have little effect on the system’s qualitative  properties. Moreover, we investigate three measures of heterogeneity of  dynamics and find that the relaxation and the diffusion motion of  particles show different responses to the pinned particles, which may  lead to the slower relaxation than diffusion and the decoupling of  relaxation and diffusion. The string-like motion is found to saturate at  the mode-coupling theory (MCT) crossover point, which indicates that  other relaxation modes may exist below the MCT transition point."
