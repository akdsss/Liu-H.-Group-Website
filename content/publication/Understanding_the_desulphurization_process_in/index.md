abstract: "An ionic porous aromatic framework, iPAF-1, was successfully  synthesized from a designed monomer with imidazolium functional groups.  The iPAF-1 exhibits the highest dibenzothiophene uptake among all  reported adsorptive desulphurization adsorbents. The so-called precursor  designed synthetic route provides the stoichiometric and homogeneous  introduction of desired functional groups into the framework. Molecular  dynamics simulation was performed to understand the structure and the  desulphurization process within the amorphous iPAF-1. The insight into  the key role of the moderate bonding interaction between the adsorbate  and the functional groups of iPAF-1 for improved uptake is highlighted  in this work."
