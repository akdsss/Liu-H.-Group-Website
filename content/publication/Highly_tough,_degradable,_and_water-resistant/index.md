It is challenging to fabricate high-performance degradable  plastics that simultaneously possess high mechanical strength,  satisfactory water resistance and rapid degradation characteristics in  natural environments using biomass resources. In this study,  mechanically robust, water-resistant, biocompatible, and degradable  plastics are fabricated through the complexation of regenerated  cellulose and tannic acid (TA) followed by molding these complexes into  desired shapes. The resulting plastic (denoted as C-TA) prepared with 15  wt% TA exhibits an ultrahigh fracture strength of ∼265 MPa and a  toughness of ∼55.2 MJ m−3. An all-atom molecular dynamics simulation  demonstrates that the introduction of dendritic TA molecules notably  enhances the toughness of the C-TA plastic through the formation of  TA-centered hydrogen-bond clusters. The C-TA plastic retains a fracture  strength of ∼166 MPa and ∼98 MPa after being stored in environments with  relative humidities of 80% and 100% for 7 days, respectively,  indicating its excellent water resistance. The good water resistance and  high mechanical strength of the C-TA plastic originate from the  hydrophobic aromatic rings of its TA molecules and its TA-centered  hydrogen-bond clusters which serve as cross-links and nanofillers to  strengthen the plastic. The C-TA plastic can be fully degraded in soil  into nontoxic species within 35 days."
