abstract: Wedderburn–Etherington number patterns, which have inherent  combinatorial rules, are ubiquitous in natural tree-like systems and are  of significance for studying the assembly of single particles into  branched superstructures. However, implementing these patterns at the  microor nanoscale is still challenging. By controlling the sequential  fusion of nanodroplets, these patterns can be reproduced in  nanometre-sized branched mesoporous silica structures. Anisotropic  mesoporous silica nanoparticles, possessing exposed reaction-active  droplet surfaces, are initially synthesized and then assembled following  WedderburnEtherington number patterns (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and so  on), forming branched nanotrees containing dimers to multimers. This  assembly is achieved by using ligand-grafted palladium nanocrystals as  an adhesive, which can fuse the droplets exposed on one side of the  preformed nanoparticles. The formed dimers have a Y-shaped architecture  with two fused branches (length, ∼395 nm; outer diameter, ∼157 nm)  connected by an open tube that grows later, and the sequential  fusion-growth style can further extend the Y-structure to multibranched  structures. Statistics can predict the degree of branching at each  assembly level. The types and configurations of branched structural  isomers can also be calculated precisely and are specified by the  Wedderburn–Etherington trees.
