Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as promising  alternatives in large-scale energy storage due to their divalent  electron redox properties, low cost, and high volumetric/gravimetric  capacity. However, the high charge density of Ca2+ contributes to strong  electrostatic interaction between divalent Ca2+ and hosting lattice,  leading to sluggish kinetics and poor rate performance. Here, in situ  formed poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS)@CNT composite is reported as  nonaqueous calcium-ion battery cathode. The enolization redox chemistry  of organics has fast redox kinetics, and the introduction of carbon  nanotube (CNT) accelerates electron transportation, which contributes to  fast ionic diffusion. As the conductivity of the PAQS is enhanced by  the increasing content of CNT, the voltage gap is significantly reduced.  The PAQS@CNT electrode exhibits specific capacity (116 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A  g−1), high rate capacity (60 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1), and an initial  capacity of 82 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 (83% capacity retention after 500  cycles). The electrochemical mechanism is proved to be that the PAQS  undergoes reduction reaction of their carbonyl bond during discharge and  becomes coordinated by Ca2+ and Ca(TFSI)+ species. Computational  simulation also suggests that the construction of Ca2+ and Ca(TFSI)+  co-intercalation in the PAQS is the most reasonable pathway."
