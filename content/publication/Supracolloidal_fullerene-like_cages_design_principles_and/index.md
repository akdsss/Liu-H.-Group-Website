abstract: How to create novel desired structures by rational design of  building blocks represents a significant challenge in materials science.  Here we report a conceptually new design principle for creating  supracolloidal fullerene-like cages through the self-assembly of soft  patchy particles interacting via directional nonbonded interactions by  mimicking non-planar sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in C60. Our numerical  investigations demonstrate that the rational design of patch  configuration, size, and interaction can drive soft three-patch  particles to reversibly self-assemble into a vast collection of  supracolloidal fullerene-like cages. We further elucidate the formation  mechanisms of supracolloidal fullerene-like cages by analyzing the  structural characteristics and the formation process. Our results  provide conceptual and practical guidance towards the experimental  realization of supracolloidal fullerene-like cages, as well as a new  perspective on understanding the fullerene formation mechanisms.
