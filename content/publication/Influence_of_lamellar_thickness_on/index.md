Probing the transformation from crystalline form II with 11/3  helical structure to form I with 3/1 helical structure in PB-1 and its  nanocomposites is of great importance in both scientific fields and  commercial applications. The influence of lamellar thickness on the  transformation from form II to form I in isotactic polybutylene-1  (PB-1)/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites was investigated by  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy  (POM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The  crystallization kinetics of PB-1/CNT nanocomposites at different  isothermal temperatures (Tc) indicates that CNTs significantly  accelerate the nucleation and growth of form II, acting as heterogeneous  nucleating agents. However, the influence of CNTs on the form II–I  transformation strongly depends on the lamellar thickness obtained at  different Tc, verified by the change in melting point (Tm) and the SAXS  results for form I. The addition of CNTs accelerates the transformation  and elevates the Tm of form I when the Tc is lower than ∼88 °C, and  slows the transformation and slightly decreases the Tm when the Tc is  higher than ∼88 °C. This is probably due to the fact that the  incorporation of CNTs facilitates an increase in lamellar thickness of  form II formed at lower Tc but decreases the lamellar thickness of form  II formed at higher Tc. Our study illustrates that the lamellar  thickness is one of the key points to determine the transformation from  form II to form I in PB-1."
