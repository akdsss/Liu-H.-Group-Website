The rapid loss of active sulfur, because of a notorious effect  of polysulfide shuttle, leads to a severe capacity fading in  lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Although oxygen doping in cathodic  materials is a promising strategy to enhance bonding interactions with  lithium polysulfides, the origin of strong interactions remains to be  poorly understood, because of a lack of consideration for the spatial  arrangement of oxygen atoms affecting the overall performances. Here, we  unveil the role of hydroxyl architecture on polysulfide trapping by  systematically studying a series of cyclodextrin molecules that serve as  a model platform, because of their well-defined structural uniqueness  featuring abundant hydroxyl binding sites. We compare their trapping  behaviors toward lithium polysulfides and thus correlate performance  variations with their structural differences. Experimental findings  coupled with computational modeling suggest that the asymmetrical  arrangement of primary hydroxyl groups in β-CD determines the highest  binding energies, relevant to the optimal capability in constraining  polysulfide shuttle, and, in turn, contributes to remarkable  improvements in the rate capacity and cycling performance. The  identification of the role of hydroxyl architecture provides an  atomic-scale explanation for the interaction between OH-group ordered  interface and lithium polysulfides, and a new insight for the future  design and engineering of interfaces in Li–S batteries."
