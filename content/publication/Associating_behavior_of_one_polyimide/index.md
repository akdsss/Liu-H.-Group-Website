abstract: "An associating polymer generally contains a small fraction of  strongly interacting groups that can form stable aggregates. In this  study, a novel soluble polyimide (PI) (6FDA-TFDB) sample with high  molecular weight is synthesized; it contains a large fraction of  relatively weak interacting groups. Investigation on the solution  property and scaling law relationship between h0-hs and volume fraction  shows that this sample exhibits the behavior of associating polymer;  this behavior ﬁts the theory of unrenormalized sticky Rouse model and  sticky reptation model in a broad volume fraction region, and the  scaling exponents in different volume fraction ranges and the critical  volume fractions are determined. Moreover, when the volume fraction is  above f* (overlap volume fraction), abnormal shear thinning phenomenon  occurs. Oscillation frequency experiment for concentrated polyimide  solutions demonstrates that the polyimide solution tends to become a gel  above the critical volume fraction due to numerous weak dipole-dipole  and p-p interactions. In the UVeVis spectra, absorption peak shows a red  shift with volume fraction, demonstrating that aggregates form in  concentrated polyimide solution. Synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray  scattering (SAXS) experiment reveals the appearance of domain, which  comes from the aggregates of PI segments. Finally, combined with the  quantum chemical calculation, one model based on relatively weak  interaction (i.e., dipole-dipole and p-p interactions) from chemical  units of polyimides is proposed to explain the associating behavior of  high molecular weight polyimide in solution and the shear thinning  phenomenon. This study broadens the range of associating polymers."
