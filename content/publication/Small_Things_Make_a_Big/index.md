Binders are crucial for maintaining the integrity of an  electrode, and there is a growing need for integrating multiple  desirable properties into the binder for high-energy batteries, yet  significant challenges remain. Here, we successfully synthesized a new  binder by cross-linking sodium alginate (SA) with MXene materials  (Ti3C2Tx). Besides the improved adhesion and mechanical properties, the  integrated SA@Ti3C2Tx binder demonstrates much improved electronic  conductivity, which enables ruling out the fluffy conductive additive  from the electrode component with enhanced volumetric capacity. When  SA@Ti3C2Tx is used to fabricate sulfur (S) cathodes, the  conductive-additive-free electrode demonstrates extremely high capacity  (1422 mAh cm–3/24.5 mAh cm–2) under an S loading of 17.2 mg cm–2 for  Li–S batteries. Impressively, the SA@Ti3C2Tx binder shows remarkable  feasibility in other battery systems such as Na–S and LiFePO4 batteries.  The proposed strategy of constructing a cross-linking conductive binder  opens new possibilities for designing high-mass-loading electrodes with  high volumetric capacity."
