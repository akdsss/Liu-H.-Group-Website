abstract: "In this study, we investigate the motion of polymer segments  in polymer/nanoparticle composites by varying nanoparticle (NP) volume  fractions. By studying the probability distribution of segment  displacement, segment trajectory, and the square displacement of  segment, we find the intermittent motion of segments, accompanied with  the coexistence of slow and fast segments in polymer nanocomposites  (PNCs). The displacement distribution of segments exhibits an  exponential tail, rather than a Gaussian form. The intermittent dynamics  of chain segments is comprised of a long-range jump motion and a  short-range localized motion, which is mediated by the weakly attractive  interaction between NP and chain segment and the strong confinement  induced by NPs. Meanwhile, the intermittent motion of chain segments can  be described by the adsorption-desorption transition at low particle  loading and confinement effect at high particle loading. These findings  may provide important information for understanding the anomalous motion  of polymer chains in the presence of NPs."
