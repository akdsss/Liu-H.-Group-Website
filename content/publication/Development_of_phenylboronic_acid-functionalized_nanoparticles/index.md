abstract: Stable and monodisperse phenylboronic acid-functionalized  nanoparticles (PBA-NPs) were fabricated using the  3-((acrylamido)methyl)phenylboronic acid homopolymer (PBAH) via the  solvent displacement technique. The effect of operating parameters,  including stirring time, initial polymer concentration and the  proportion of methanol, on the self-assembly process was systematically  investigated. The diameters of PBA-NPs were increased by increasing the  initial PBAH concentration and the proportion of methanol. Likewise,  there was a linear dependence between the size of self-assembled  nanoparticles and the polymer concentration. Moreover, the dissipative  particle dynamics (DPD) simulation technique was used to investigate the  mechanism of self-assembly behavior of the PBAH, which indicated that  the interior of PBA-NPs was hydrophobic and compact, and boronic acid  groups were displayed on both the exterior and interior of PBA-NPs. The  resulting PBA-NPs could successfully encapsulate emodin through PBA–diol  interaction and the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and drug loading  content (DLC%) of drug-loaded PBA-NPs were 78% and 2.1%, respectively.  Owing to the acid-labile feature of the boronate linkage, a reduction in  environmental pH from 7.4 to 5.0 could trigger the disassociation of  the boronate ester bonds, which could accelerate the drug release from  PBA–emodin-NPs. Besides, PBA–emodin-NPs showed a much higher  cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells (cancer cells) than MC-3T3-E1 cells (normal  cells). These results imply that PBA-NPs would be a promising scaffold  for the delivery of polyphenolic drugs.
