abstract: "The capability of polyelectrolyte brushes to spontaneously  clean oil fouling via water is determined by factors including water  wettability and the self-assembled structures of hydrated  polyelectrolytes. Although the charged groups of polyelectrolytes  provide the original source of water wettability, the self-assembled  structures play a significant role in the self-cleaning performances.  Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study  the general self-cleaning characteristics of two types of  surface-grafted polyelectrolyte brushes (i.e., zwitterionic and anionic  polyelectrolytes). It has been found that the high grafting density is  favorable to fouling reduction for both polyzwitterions and polyanions.  To be specific, the hydrated polyzwitterions form an intermolecular  cross-linked network via zwitterionic complexes, resulting in better  self-cleaning capabilities than the polyanions at lower grafting  densities. However, polyanions form bundles with each consisting of  several chains via hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic repulsions  presenting better self-cleaning performances than the polyzwitterions  at higher grafting densities."
