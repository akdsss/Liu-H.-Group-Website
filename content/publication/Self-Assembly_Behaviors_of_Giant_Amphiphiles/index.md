abstract: We have studied the self-assembly of two types of amphiphiles  with one or two blocks composed of giant “monomers” of the cubic cage  using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations with the aim to  elucidate the influence of the giant monomers on the self-assembly  behavior by comparing their self-assembly behaviors with those of  conventional AB diblock copolymers. The conformation-symmetric  amphiphile with two blocks of giant monomers exhibits a similar  transition sequence as that of AB diblock except for the  perforated-lamellar morphology replacing the usual double-gyroid  morphology. The formation of the PL morphology is attributed to the  rigid shape of the cubic monomer as well as the dominant interfacial  contribution resulting from the large size of the giant monomer. The  other amphiphile with an A block of giant monomers and a B block of  conventional monomers has a highly asymmetric conformation due to the  large difference in monomer sizes, and thus its phase boundaries are  significantly deflected. Moreover, the packing constraint of the rigid  cubic A cages leads to the formation of a novel morphology, ill-defined  (ID) A-network morphology. In addition, we find that the order–disorder  transition temperature is lowered as beads in either A or B block are  clustered into the cubic cages. Although the monomer model of the cubic  cage is coarsened from the real POSS monomer in the experiments, our  simulation results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental  results.
