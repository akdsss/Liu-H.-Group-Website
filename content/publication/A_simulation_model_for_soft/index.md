abstract: "We present a mesoscale simulation model that is suitable for  describing the deformable and non-centrosymmetric characteristics of  soft triblock Janus particles. The model parameters are readily mapped  onto experimental systems under different ambient conditions. We examine  the influence of Janus balance and the flexibility of Janus particle  aggregates on the packing structures. Some ordered structures, such as  the hexagonal columnar structure and the body-centered tetragonal  structure, are observed in our simulations. Our study demonstrates that  the Janus balance and the flexibility of Janus particle aggregates can  be tuned to obtain various ordered packing structures. The soft Janus  particles with soft and deformable characteristics may bring new  excitement to materials science."
