abstract: "Chiral helical structures have attracted increasing attention  in the field of supramolecular assembly because of their critical roles  in life and material sciences. In this research, the achiral amphiphile  1-[11-(2-anthracenylmethoxy)-11-oxoundecyl]pyridinium bromide (2-APB),  in which the hydrophobic anthracene and the hydrophilic pyridinium units  are linked by alkyl chains, was found to form chiral supramolecular  assemblies in a cooperative manner in the presence of iodide anion.  Moreover, these assemblies show left (L)- or right (R)-handedness  randomly, independent of the assembly conditions. By using the same  method, 2-APB could assemble together with other pseudo-halogen anions  (OCN−, SCN−, SeCN−) that have similar anionic radius as iodide to form  chiral structures. This work illustrates a simple and rational design  that can be used to fabricate supramolecular chiral structures from  achiral molecules."
