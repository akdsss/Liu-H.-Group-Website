abstract: Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II)  window is well suited for biological systems due to lower tissue  scattering and micrometer-scale resolution at depths of millimeters.  Unfortunately, none of the NIR-II fluorophores have clinical application  due to low quantum yields, poor photostability, and longterm biosafety  concerns. Herein, we develop NIR-II fluorescent nanoprobes based on the  "isolated cage" monodisperse strategy, which significantly inhibits the  π-π stacking interactions and restricts internal rotation of the  arrested indocyanine green (ICG) fluorophores, which minimizes  aggregation-caused quenching and enhances their NIR-II imaging  performance. Unlike ICG's imaging window of several minutes, the  nanoformulations have reduced photobleaching and provide longer  observation times. The increased imaging time allows high spatiotemporal  resolution of blood vessels and lymphatic system. Benefiting from the  high resolution and sensitivity of the nanoprobes, sentinel lymph nodes  are accurately removed under fluorescence navigation. More intriguingly,  the patency of lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) is presented more  intuitively by qualitative and quantitative NIR-II fluorescence signals,  which will directly benefit the innovation and promotion of LVA.
