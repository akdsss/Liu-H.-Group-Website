Designing complex cluster crystals with a speciﬁc function  using simple colloidal building blocks remains a challenge in materials  science. Herein, we propose a conceptually new design strategy for  constructing complex cluster crystals via hierarchical self-assembly of  simple soft Janus colloids. A novel and previously unreported colloidal  cluster-χ (χc) phase, which resembles the essential structural features  of α-manganese but at a larger length scale, is obtained through  molecular dynamics simulations. The formation of the χc phase undergoes a  remarkable two-step selfassembly process, that is, the self-assembly of  clusters with speciﬁc size dispersity from Janus colloids, followed by  the highly ordered organization of these clusters. More importantly, the  dynamic exchange of particles between these clusters plays a critical  role in stabilizing the χc phase. Such a conceptual design framework  based on intercluster exchange has the potential to eﬀectively construct  novel complex cluster crystals by hierarchical self-assembly of  colloidal building blocks."
