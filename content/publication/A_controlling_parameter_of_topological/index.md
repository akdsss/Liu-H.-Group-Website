abstract: Synthesis of covalent organic frameworks with long-range  molecular ordering is an outstanding challenge due to the fact that  defects against predesigned topological symmetries are prone to form and  break crystallization. The physical origins and controlling parameters  of topological defects remain scarcely understood. By virtue of  molecular dynamics simulations, we found that pentagons for combination  [C4 + C4] and [C4 + C2] and heptagons for [C3 + C3] and [C3 + C2] were  initial defects for growth dynamics with both uncontrolled and  suppressed nucleation, further inducing more complex defects. The  defects can be significantly reduced by achieving the growth with  monomers added to a single nucleus, agreeing well with previous  simulations and experiments. To understand the nature of defects, we  proposed a parameter φ to describe the range of biased rotational angle  between two monomers, within which chemical reactions are allowed. The  parameter φ shows a monotonic relationship with defect population, which  is demonstrated to be highly computable by using density functional  theory calculations. When φ < 20, we can even observe defect-free  growth for the four combinations, irrespective of growth dynamics. The  results are essential for screening and designing condensation reactions  for the synthesis of single crystals of high quality.
