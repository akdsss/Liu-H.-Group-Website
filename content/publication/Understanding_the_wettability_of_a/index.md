abstract: We present a computer simulation study on the wettability of a  hairy surface with different topological structures such as single  hairs, hair bundles and network structure. Superficially, for  end-tethered rigid hairs or flexible hairs, the nonwettability of the  substrate should be analyzed in completely different ways. For rigid  hairs, the contact angle is dominantly dependent on the top layer  density of hairs. A larger top layer density leads to a larger  interaction between droplet and surface, as well as a lower contact  angle. For flexible hairs, the nonwettability is determined by the  typical properties of hairs right below the droplet, e.g., the chemistry  of the surface, the topography and strength of the hair bundle/network  or nonwetted area below the projection of the droplet. Nevertheless, it  is also possible to generalize these aspects into a uniform procedure,  which implies an intrinsic consistent mechanism of the dewetting  behavior for droplets on such hairy surfaces. Counterintuitively, we  also suggest that the surface which can strongly resist the transition  to the Wenzel state does not necessarily lead to a large contact angle,  especially in a system where the droplet is treated as liquid bulk. This  study helps to build up guidelines for the design of nonwetting surface  materials.
