abstract: Elastomers play an irreplaceable role in industry and daily  life; however, they are usually soft and susceptible to damage. In this  study, skin-like poly(urethane-urea) elastomers with high mechanical  strength, stretchability, elasticity, and excellent damage resistance,  damage tolerance, and healability are fabricated by cross-linking  polycaprolactone (PCL) chains with hydrogen-bond arrays. The elastomer,  which is denoted as PU-ASC, has a tensile strength of ∼72.6 MPa,  recovery strain of ∼500%, and fracture energy of ∼161 kJ m–2. Moreover,  the PU-ASC elastomer exhibits unique strain-adaptive stiffening, which  endows the elastomer with the capacity to resist damage. The skin-like  PU-ASC-IL conductors can be conveniently fabricated by loading ionic  liquids (ILs) into the PU-ASC elastomers. The healable, stretchable,  elastic, damage-resistant, and damage-tolerant PU-ASC-IL conductors show  record-high mechanical performance, with tensile strength, toughness,  and fracture energy values of ∼22.8 MPa, ∼164.2 MJ m–3, and ∼73.6 kJ  m–2, respectively. The damage resistance and damage tolerance of the  elastomers and conductors mainly originate from the disintegrable  hydrogen-bond arrays, which are capable of dissipating energy, and the  strain-induced crystallization of the PCL segments. Owing to the  reversibility of the hydrogen-bond arrays, fractured PU-ASC and  PU-ASC-IL can be conveniently healed under heating, restoring their  original mechanical performance and conductivity.
