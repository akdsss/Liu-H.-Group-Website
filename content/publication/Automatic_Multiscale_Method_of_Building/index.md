abstract: An automatic method is introduced to generate the initial  configuration and input file from SMILES for multiscale molecular  dynamics (MD) simulation of cross-linked polymer reaction systems.  Inputs are a modified version of SMILES of all the components and  conditions of coarse-grained (CG) and all-atom (AA) simulations. The  overall process comprises the following steps:(1) Modified SMILES  inputs of all the components are converted to 3-dimensional coordinates  of molecular structures. (2) Molecular structures are mapped to the  coarse-grained scale, followed by a CG reaction simulation. (3) CG beads  are backmapped to the atomic scale after the CG reaction. (4) An AA  productive run is finally performed to analyze volume shrinkage, glass  transition, and atomic detail of network structure. The method is  applied to two common epoxy resin reactions, that is, the cross-linking  process of DGEVA (diglycidyl ether of vanillyl alcohol) and DHAVA  (dihydroxyaminopropane of vanillyl alcohol) and that of DGEBA  (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) and DETA (diethylenetriamine). These  components form network structures after the CG cross-linking reaction  and are then backmapped to calculate properties in the atomic scale. The  result demonstrates that the method can accurately predict volume  shrinkage, glass transition, and all-atom structure of cross-linked  polymers. The method bridges from SMILES to MD simulation trajectories  in an automatic way, which shortens the time of building up cross-linked  polymer reaction model and suitable for high-throughput computations.
