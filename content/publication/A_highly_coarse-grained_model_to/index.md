abstract: We introduce a highly coarse-grained model to simulate the  entangled polymer melts. In this model, a polymer chain is taken as a  single coarse-grained particle, and the creation and annihilation of  entanglements are regarded as stochastic events in proper time intervals  according to certain rules and possibilities. We build the relationship  between the probability of appearance of an entanglement between any  pair of neighboring chains at a given time interval and the rate of  variation of entanglements which describes the concurrence of birth and  death of entanglements. The probability of disappearance of  entanglements is tuned to keep the total entanglement number around the  target value. This useful model can reflect many characteristics of  entanglements and macroscopic properties of polymer melts. As an  illustration, we apply this model to simulate the polyethylene melt of  C1000H2002 at 450 K and further validate this model by comparing to  experimental data and other simulation results.
