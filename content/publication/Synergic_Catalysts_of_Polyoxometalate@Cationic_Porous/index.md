abstract: Abstract             Compositional catalysts based on porous supports and  incorporated catalytic nanoparticles have achieved great successes  during the past decades. However, rational design of synergic catalysts  and modulating the interactions between functional supports and  catalytic sites are still far from being well developed. In this work,  aiming at overcoming the difficulties of comprehensive screening of  porous supports and correspondingly matched catalytic sites, a cationic  porous aromatic framework as a capturing platform and polyoxometalate  anions as conversion materials are separately designed, and their  combination is modularly controlled. The resulting composites show  higher catalytic activities than the corresponding conversion sites  themselves. Notably, the resulting composites uncommonly exhibit  increased surface area and enlarged pore openings after the  incorporation of nanoparticles, and lead to the promotion of mass  transfer within the porous supports. The emergence of a hierarchical  structure with increased surface area induced by guest loading is  desired in heterogeneous catalysis. The reciprocal modulation of both  capture and conversion materials results in enhanced conversion and  increased reaction rate, indicating the successful preparation of  synergic catalysts by this separate design approach.
