Unlike one-dimensional polymers, the theoretical framework on  the behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) polymers is far from completeness.  In this study, we model single-layer flexible 2D polymers of different  sizes and examine their scaling behaviors in solution, represented by Rg  ∼ Lν, where Rg is the radius of gyration and L is the side length of a  2D polymer. We find that the scaling exponent ν is 0.96 for a good  solvent and 0.64 for under poor solvent condition. Interestingly, we  observe a previously unnoticed phenomenon:under intermediate solvent  conditions, the 2D polymer folds to maintain a flat structure, and as L  becomes larger, multiple folded structures emerge. We introduce a shape  parameter Q to diagram the relationship of folded structures with the  polymer size and solvent condition. Theoretically, we explain the  folding transitions by the competition between bending and solvophobic  free energies."
