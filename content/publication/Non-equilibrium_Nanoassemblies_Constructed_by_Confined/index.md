abstract: "Biological systems employ non-equilibrium self-assembly to  create ordered nanoarchitectures with sophisticated functions. However,  it is challenging to construct artificial non-equilibrium nanoassemblies  due to lack of control over assembly dynamics and kinetics. Herein, we  design a series of linear polymers with different side groups for  further coordination-driven self-assembly based on  shape-complementarity. Such a design introduces a main-chain confinement  which effectively slows down the assembly process of side groups, thus  allowing us to monitor the real-time evolution of lychee-like  nanostructures. The function related to the non-equilibrium nature is  further explored by performing photothermal conversion study. The  ability to observe and capture non-equilibrium states in this  supramolecular system will enhance our understanding of the  thermodynamic and kinetic features as well as functions of living  systems."
