abstract: Coarse-grained models for β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and adamantane  (ADA) are proposed by ﬁtting to their experimental host−guest complex  equilibrium constant in solution. By using Brownian dynamics  simulations, we suggest a simple supramolecular route for synthesizing  multiblock copolymers (MBCs) via forming complexes between β-CD and ADA  groups terminated at the chain ends of diblock copolymers (DBCs). The  chain length distribution of the resulted MBC is found to follow the  statistics of Flory formula for typical linear condensation  polymerization process. Therefore, the proposed supramolecular route can  be viewed as a novel linear condensation polymerization process with  DBCs as reactive monomers. Due to the complex formations between head  and tail (β-CD and ADA), ringshaped MBCs are also observed in our  simulations, which will reduce the yield of the MBC. Because we are  using a generic model for DBC, the proposed route of building MBCs are  applicable for all synthetic DBCs with two ends terminated by either  β-CD or ADA groups.
