abstract: Precise tailoring of pore chemistry is indispensable for  efficient membrane gas separation, particularly for the challenging  acetylene system. Here, a strategy called “anion substitution” is  reported, to strengthen the interaction between anions and acetylene  within the pores, for radically improving gas selectivity and  permeability. The anions F− and OH− are infixed in iPAF-1 to replace the  original Cl− ion. Their small anionic radii allow retention of the  original high porosity of iPAF-1-Cl in iPAF-1-F and iPAF-1-OH. Highly  basic F− and OH− confined in the pores attract acidic acetylene strongly  and preferentially. Nanoparticles of iPAF-1 are processed to form mixed  matrix membranes, represented by iPAF-1-OH/6FDA-ODA. The prepared  membranes exhibit remarkable performance in separating acetylene from  ethylene and ethane. Transplantation of porous and functional iPAF-1-OH  into 6FDA-ODA significantly enhances both acetylene permeability  (sevenfold) and permselectivity (fivefold) for acetylene over ethylene  and ethane, which is crucial for membrane acetylene gas separation.
