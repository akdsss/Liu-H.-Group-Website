abstract: "Soft fibres can be used to make smart textiles for use in  energy, sensing and therapeutic applications. However, the fabrication  of functional fibres is difficult compared with the fabrication of  two-dimensional films and three-dimensional monoliths, and current  methods typically require high temperatures, high volumes of solvents or  complex systems. Here we report a spinning approach to fabricate  functional fibres, which is based on spontaneous phase separation and is  inspired by the silk-spinning processes of spiders. The silk-spinning  process is mimicked by creating a spinning solution of polyacrylonitrile  and silver ions, which forms an elastic supramolecular network with  silver coordination complexes and in situ reduced silver nanoparticles.  This approach, which operates at ambient pressure and temperature, can  be used to make soft functional fibres that are mechanically stretchable  (more than 500% strain), strong (more than 6 MPa) and electrically  conductive (around 1.82 S m−1). To illustrate the capabilities of the  technique, we use the fibres to create a sensing glove and a smart face  mask."
