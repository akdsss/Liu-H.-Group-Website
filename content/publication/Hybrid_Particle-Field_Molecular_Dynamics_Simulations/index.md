We develop and test specific coarse-grained models for charged  amphiphilic systems such as  palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol  (POPG) lipid bilayer, and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)  surfactant in  aqueous environment, to verify the ability of the hybrid particle-field  method to provide a  realistic description of polyelectrolyte  soft-matter systems. According to the hybrid approach, the   intramolecular interactions are treated by a standard molecular  Hamiltonian and the non-electrostatic  intermolecular forces are  described by density fields. Electrostatics is introduced as an  additional  external field obtained by a modified particle-mesh Ewald  procedure, as recently proposed in [Phys.  Chem. Chem. Phys 2016, 18,  9799]. Our results show that, upon proper calibration of key parameters,   electrostatic forces can be correctly reproduced. Molecular dynamics  simulations indicate that the  methodology is robust with respect to the  choice of the relative dielectric constant, yielding the same  correct  qualitative behavior for a broad range of values. In particular, our  methodology reproduces well  the organization of the POPG bilayer, as  well as the SDS concentration-dependent change in the  morphology of the  micelles from spherical to microtubular aggregates. The inclusion of  explicit  electrostatics with good accuracy and low computational costs  paves the way for a significant extension  of the hybrid particle field  method to biological systems, where the polyelectrolyte component plays a   fundamental role for both structural and dynamical molecular  properties."
