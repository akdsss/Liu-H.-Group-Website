abstract: Advanced proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are highly desirable  in emerging sustainable energy technology. However, the further  improvement of commercial perfluorosulfonic acid PEMs represented by  Nafion is hindered by the lack of precise modification strategy due to  their chemical inertness and low compatibility. Here, we report the  robust assembly of polyethylene glycol grafted polyoxometalate  amphiphile (GSiW11) into the ionic nanophases of Nafion, which largely  enhances the comprehensive performance of Nafion. GSiW11 can coassemble  with Nafion through multiple supramolecular interactions and realize a  stable immobilization. The incorporation of GSiW11 can increase the  whole proton content in the system and induce the hydrated ionic  nanophase to form a wide channel for proton transport; meanwhile, GSiW11  can reinforce the Nafion ionic nanophase by noncovalent cross-linking.  Based on these synergistic effects, the hybrid PEMs show multiple  enhancements in proton conductivity, tensile strength, and fuel cell  power density, which are all superior to the pristine Nafion. This work  demonstrates the intriguing advantage of molecular nanoclusters as  supramolecular enhancers to develop high-performance electrolyte  materials.
