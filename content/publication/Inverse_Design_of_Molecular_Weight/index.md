Synthesizing polymers with tailor-made molecular weight  distribution (MWD) is an essential step toward better control and design  of functional polymer materials. We propose a novel one-pot reaction  strategy that can facilitate the inverse design of the shape, breadth,  and skew of the MWD in a controlled polymerization. By a multistep  initiator addition scheme that involves a sequence of addition  operations with determined amounts of initiators and addition times, the  polymers with target MWD can be possibly synthesized. This strategy is  in principle suitable to reproduce most target MWDs, even with a  multimodal profile or with large breadth and/or skew. As compared to  previous relevant methods by blending polymers with determined molar  masses and ratios, this one-pot reaction strategy avoids most of the  tedious intermediate steps for controlling precision in blending and  would be more convenient and timesaving. Our study supplies the  inspiration of better control of synthesizing polymers with designated  MWD in controlled polymerization."
