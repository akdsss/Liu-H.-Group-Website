We study the self-assembly behaviour of two-patch particles  with D1h symmetry by using Brownian dynamics simulations. The  self-assembly process of two-patch particles with diverse patch coverage  in two selective solvent conditions is investigated. The patchy  particles in a solvent that is bad for patches but good for matrix form  linear thread-like structures with low patch coverage, whereas they form  3D network structures with relatively high patch coverage on surface.  For patchy particles in a solvent which is good for patches but bad for  body, monolayer structures are obtained at high patch coverage, and some  cluster structures emerge when surface patch coverage is low."
