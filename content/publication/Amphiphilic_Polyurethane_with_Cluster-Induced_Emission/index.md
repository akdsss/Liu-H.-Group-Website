The development of single-component materials with low  cytotoxicity and multichannel fluorescence imaging capability is a  research hotspot. In the present work, highly electron-deficient  pyrazine monomers were covalently connected into a polyurethane backbone  using addition polymerization with terminal poly(ethylene glycol)  monomethyl ether units containing a high density of electron pairs.  Thereby, an amphiphilic polyurethane-pyrazine (PUP) derivative has been  synthesized. The polymer displays cluster-induced emission through  compact inter- and/or intramolecular noncovalent interactions and  extensive through-space electron coupling and delocalization. Molecular  rigidity facilitates red-shifted emission. Based on  hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions and excitation dependence emission  at low concentrations, PUP has been self-assembled into fluorescent  nanoparticles (PUP NPs) without additional surfactant. PUP NPs have been  used for cellular multicolor imaging to provide a variety of switchable  colors on demand. This work provides a simple molecular design for  environmentally sustainable, luminescent materials with excellent  photophysical properties, biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and color  modulation."
