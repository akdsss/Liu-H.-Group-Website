abstract: "Self-sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with  biomimetic proprio-/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular  systems. Existing add-on approaches, which physically blend  heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding  satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor  adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single  homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver–polymer  framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing–actuation  unification. The SPF-enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%),  conductive (0.076 S m−1), and strong (0.76 MPa in-strength), where the  stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles  reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the  multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical  and thermal cues), self-sensing actuation (proprio-deformations and  external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF-based pneumatic  actuator, alongside an excellent load-lifting attribute (up to 3700  times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified  sensing–actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of  its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the  reported SPF bodes well for use with next-generation functional tissues,  including artificial skins, human–machine interfaces, self-sensing  robots, and otherwise dynamic materials."
