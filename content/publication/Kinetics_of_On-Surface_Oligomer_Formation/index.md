abstract: "The concentration-in-control strategy is a versatile and  powerful approach to construct a variety of low-dimensional  nanostructures. However, little is known about the mechanistic aspects  of the concentration-dependent formation of oligomers on the solid  surface. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulation to give  insight into the formation of oligomers, involving dimers and zigzag  polymers, which are controlled upon adjusting kinetics via monomer  concentrations. Our analyses indicate that concentration-dependent  nucleation determines the size and topology of oligomers, and the  correlation between reactions and diffusion of monomers significantly  influences the crystallinity of oligomers. Our study suggests that a  highly reversible reaction combined with rapid monomer diffusion can  promote the crystalline quality of oligomers."
