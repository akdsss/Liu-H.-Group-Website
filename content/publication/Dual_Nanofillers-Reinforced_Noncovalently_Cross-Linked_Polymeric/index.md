Noncovalently cross-linked polymer materials through healing,  recycling, and reprocessing can reduce materials consumption and  alleviate environmental pollution. However, it remains a huge challenge  to fabricate super-strong noncovalently cross-linked polymer materials  with mechanical strength comparable to high-performance engineering  polymers. Herein, healable and reprocessable noncovalently cross-linked  polymer composites with an unprecedented mechanical strength are  fabricated by complexation of polyacrylic acid (PAA),  polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPON), and carbonized polymer dots (CPDs)  (denoted as PAA-PVPON-CPDs). The incorporation of 15 wt % CPDs generates  PAA-PVPON-CPDs composites with a tensile strength of ∼158 MPa and  Young’s modulus of ∼8.2 GPa. Serving as nanoﬁllers, the CPDs can  establish strong interactions with polymers in PAA-PVPON composites. The  CPDs and the in situ-formed PAAPVPON nanoparticles work in concert to  signiﬁcantly strengthen the PAA-PVPON-CPDs composites to an  unprecedented strength. The PAA-PVPON-CPDs composites exhibit excellent  impact resistance and damage tolerance because of the high mechanical  strength of the composites and the energy dissipation mechanism of the  CPDs and PAA-PVPON nanoparticles. Moreover, the fractured PAA-PVPON-CPDs  composites can be healed to restore their original mechanical strength."
