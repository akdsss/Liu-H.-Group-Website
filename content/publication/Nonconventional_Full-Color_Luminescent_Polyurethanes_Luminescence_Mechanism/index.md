The study of structure−activity relationships is a top  priority in the development of nontraditional luminescent materials. In  this work, nonconjugated polyurethanes (PUs) with full-color emission  (red, green, and blue) are easily obtained by control of the diol  monomer structure and the polymerization conditions. Selected diol  monomers introduced single, double, or triple bond repeating units into  the main chain of the PUs, in order to understand how unsaturated bonds  and H-bonds affect their luminescence from a molecular orbital  viewpoint. Detailed experimental and theoretical results show that the  PUs have different temperature-dependent behaviors related to the  interplay of H-bonding, through-space n−π interactions, and aggregation  properties. The potential applications of PUs in colorful displays,  covert information transmission, and multifunctional bioimaging have  been verified. This work provides a new general protocol for the simple  preparation of multifunctional nonconventional fluorescent polymers and  deepens the understanding of their luminescence mechanisms."
