abstract: We present a general patchy ellipsoidal particle model  suitable for conducting dynamics simulations of the aggregation  behaviors of various shape- and/or surface-anisotropic colloids,  especially patchy ellipsoids with continuously variable shape and  tunable patchiness. To achieve higher computational efficiency in  dynamics simulations, we employ a multi-GPU acceleration technique based  on a domain decomposition algorithm. The validation and performance  evaluation of this GPU-assisted model are performed by simulating  several typical benchmark systems of non-patchy and patchy ellipsoids.  Given the generality and efficiency of our GPU-assisted patchy  ellipsoidal particle model, it will provide a highly feasible dynamics  simulation framework to investigate the aggregation behaviors of  anisotropic soft matter systems comprised of shape- and/or  surface-anisotropic building blocks.
