abstract: "Organic materials are promising for cation storage in calcium  ion batteries (CIBs). However, the high solubility of organic materials  in an electrolyte and low electronic conductivity remain the key  challenges for high-performance CIBs. Herein, a nitrogen-rich covalent  organic framework with multiple carbonyls (TB-COF) is designed as an  aqueous anode to address those obstacles. TB-COF demonstrates a high  reversible capacity of 253 mAh g–1 at 1.0 A g–1 and long cycle life  (0.01% capacity decay per cycle at 5 A g–1 after 3000 cycles). The redox  mechanism of Ca2+/H+ co-intercalated in COF and chelating with C═O and  C═N active sites is validated. In addition, a novel C═C active site was  identified for Ca2+ ion storage. Both computational and empirical  results reveal that per TB-COF repetitive unit, up to nine Ca2+ ions are  stored after three staggered intercalation steps, involving three  distinct Ca2+ ion storage sites. Finally, the evolution process of  radical intermediates further elucidates the C═C reaction mechanism."
