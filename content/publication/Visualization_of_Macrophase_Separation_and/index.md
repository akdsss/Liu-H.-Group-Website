abstract: "Identification and visualization of phase structures inside polymer blends are of          critical importance in the understanding of their intrinsic structure and dynamics.          However, the direct optical observation of the individual component phase in a dense          bulk material poses a significant challenge. Herein, three-dimensional fluorescence          imaging of phase separation and real-time visualization of phase transformation in          immiscible polymer blends of polypropylene and polystyrene is realized through multiphoton          laser scanning microscopy. Owing to the specific fluorescence behavior of the cyanostyrene          derivative 2-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(4-(4-(diphenylamino)styryl)phenyl)fumaronitrile, the          high-contrast imaging of the macrophase of the component polymer in two and three          dimensions with a maximum depth of 140 μm and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 300          can be achieved. Detailed spectroscopic and structural studies reveal that the distinctive          fluorescence features of each phase domain should originate from the formation of          a completely different aggregate between probes and component polymer. Furthermore,          visualizations of the internal morphology deformation and macrophase transformation          were realized by employing a stretched dumbbell sample under constant tension."
