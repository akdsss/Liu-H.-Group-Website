The design and discovery of new two-dimensional materials with  desired structures and properties are always one of the most  fundamental goals in materials science. Here we present an  atom-mimicking design concept to achieve direct self-assembly of  two-dimensional low-coordinated open lattices using three-dimensional  patchy particle systems. Besides honeycomb lattices, a new type of  two-dimensional square-octagon lattice is obtained through rational  design of the patch configuration of soft three-patch particles.  However, unexpectedly the building blocks with thermodynamically  favoured patch configuration cannot form square-octagon lattices in our  simulations. We further reveal the kinetic mechanisms controlling the  formation of the honeycomb and square-octagon lattices. The results  indicate that the kinetically favoured intermediates play a critical  role in determining the structure of obtained open lattices. This  kinetics-controlled design principle provides a particularly effective  and extendable framework to construct other novel open lattice  structures."
