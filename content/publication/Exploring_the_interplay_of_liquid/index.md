abstract: "The application of liquid crystal technology typically relies  on the precise control of molecular orientation at a surface or  interface. This control can be achieved through a combination of  morphological and chemical methods. Consequently, variations in  constrained boundary flexibility can result in a diverse range of phase  behaviors. In this study, we delve into the self-assembly of liquid  crystals within elastic spatial confinement by using the Gay–Berne model  with the aid of molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal  that a spherical elastic shell promotes a more regular and orderly  alignment of liquid crystals compared to a hard shell. Moreover, during  the cooling process, the hard-shell confined system undergoes an  isotropic–smectic phase transition. In contrast, the phase behavior  within the spherical elastic shell closely mirrors the  isotropic–nematic–smectic phase transition observed in bulk systems.  This indicates that the orientational arrangement of liquid crystals and  the deformations induced by a flexible interface engage in a  competitive interplay during the self-assembly process. Importantly, we  found that phase behavior could be manipulated by altering the  flexibility of the confined boundaries. This insight offers a fresh  perspective for the design of innovative materials, particularly in the  realm of liquid crystal/polymer composites."
