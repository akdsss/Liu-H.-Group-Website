The polymer-grafted nanoparticles prepared by the  surface-initiated polymerization induced from the spherical surface is  studied by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations combined with  the stochastic reaction model. The coupling effect of the initiator  density and the grafting surface curvature is mainly investigated. The  confinement degree greatly changes with the grafting surface curvature,  thus the initiation efficiency, the grafted chain polydispersity, as  well as the chain mass distribution show great dependence on the surface  curvature. The results reveal that preparing the nanoparticle with  desired size (i.e., grafting surface curvature) is crucial for control  of the grafted chain polydispersity and even its dispersion in the  polymer matrix. Our studies shed light on better design of grafted  nanoparticles and better control of dispersion in polymer matrices for  improving the performance of polymer nanocomposite materials."
