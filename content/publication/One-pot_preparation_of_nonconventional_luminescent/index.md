abstract: Nonconventional chromophores are good candidates for preparing  luminous gels because their luminescence is usually enhanced in the  aggregated state. In this work, a simple one-pot strategy for  polymerization-induced gelation of polymer fluorescent gels was  developed, and a self physically crosslinked luminous gel PUHG based on a  non-conjugated/nonconventional luminous polyurethane derivative was  obtained. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies probed the  physical properties and luminescence principles of PUHG's aggregated  state. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that abundant non-covalent  interactions and physical entanglement between polyurethane chains are  the main driving forces of gel formation and the source of luminescence.  PUHG displays stable photophysical properties, environmental tolerance,  good adhesion properties and processability, leading to the validation  of patterning applications of PUHG on different organic/inorganic  substrates. This work broadens the application range of nonconventional  luminous polymers and provides a simple route for large-scale  preparation of fluorescent gel soft materials.
