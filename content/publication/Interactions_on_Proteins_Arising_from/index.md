abstract: "Surfaces grafted with polyelectrolyte chains for excellent  performance in protein antifouling are highly desired in many  applications, such as biomedical implants and devices. In general, the  adsorbing/resisting behaviors of proteins can be mainly attributed to  the electrostatic interactions that are associated with the charge  properties of proteins and polyelectrolytes. By coarse-grained molecular  dynamics simulations, we examined the self-assembled structures of  polyanion and polyzwitterion brushes as well as the interactions on  negatively and positively charged proteins. We found that in addition to  charges, the structural polarization induced by self-assembly with a  certain charge distribution shows significant influences on protein  behavior. The large-scale dipole–dipole interactions between brushes and  proteins can dominate the behavior of proteins on the brushes under  certain circumstances. To ensure simulation accuracy, we compared two  models and found a polar Martini model that explicitly treats  electrostatic interactions as long-ranged ones, giving a more reasonable  structural description compared with the normal Martini model that  truncates electrostatic interactions."
