Janus nanoparticles could exhibit a higher interfacial  activity and adsorb stronger to fluid interfaces than homogeneous  nanoparticles of similar sizes. However, little is known about the  interfacial diffusion of Janus nanoparticles and how it compares to that  of homogeneous ones. Here, we employed fluorescence correlation  spectroscopy to study the lateral diffusion of ligand-grafted Janus  nanoparticles adsorbed at water/oil interfaces. We found that the  diffusion was significantly slower than that of homogeneous  nanoparticles. We carried out dissipative particle dynamic simulations  to study the mechanism of interfacial slowdown. Good agreement between  experimental and simulation results has been obtained only provided that  the flexibility of ligands grafted on the nanoparticle surface was  taken into account. The polymeric ligands were deformed and oriented at  an interface so that the effective radius of Janus nanoparticles is  larger than the nominal one obtained by measuring the diffusion in bulk  solution. These findings highlight further the critical importance of  the ligands grafted on Janus nanoparticles for applications involving  nanoparticle adsorption at an interface, such as oil recovery or  two-dimensional self-assembly."
