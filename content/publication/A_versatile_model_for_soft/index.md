We propose a simple and general mesoscale soft patchy particle  model, which can felicitously describe the deformable and  surface-anisotropic characteristics of soft patchy particles. This model  can be used in dynamics simulations to investigate the aggregation  behavior and mechanism of various types of soft patchy particles with  tunable number, size, direction, and geometrical arrangement of the  patches. To improve the computational efficiency of this mesoscale model  in dynamics simulations, we give the simulation algorithm that fits the  compute unified device architecture (CUDA) framework of NVIDIA graphics  processing units (GPUs). The validation of the model and the  performance of the simulations using GPUs are demonstrated by simulating  several benchmark systems of soft patchy particles with 1 to 4 patches  in a regular geometrical arrangement. Because of its simplicity and  computational efficiency, the soft patchy particle model will provide a  powerful tool to investigate the aggregation behavior of soft patchy  particles, such as patchy micelles, patchy microgels, and patchy  dendrimers, over larger spatial and temporal scales."
