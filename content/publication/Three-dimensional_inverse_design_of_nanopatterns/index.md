abstract: We propose a facile inverse design strategy to generate  three-dimensional (3D) nanopatterns by using either block copolymers or a  binary homopolymer blend via dissipative particle dynamics simulations.  We find that the composition window of block copolymers to form a  specific 3D morphology can be expanded when the self-assembly of block  copolymers is directed by templates. We also find that a binary  homopolymer blend can serve as a better candidate in the inverse  templating design, since they have similar performances on recovering  the target pattern, with much lower cost. This strategy is proved  efficient for fabricating templates with desired topographical  configuration, and the inverse design idea sheds lights on better  control and design of materials with complex nanopatterns.
