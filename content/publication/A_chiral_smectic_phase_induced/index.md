abstract: Using simple achiral building blocks modulated by an external  field to achieve chiral liquid crystal phases remains a challenge. In  this study, a chiral helix liquid crystal phase is obtained for a simple  Gay–Berne ellipsoid model under an alternating external field by using  molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the chiral helix  liquid crystal phase can be observed in a wide range of external field  strengths when the oscillation period is smaller than the rotational  characteristic diffusion timescale of ellipsoids. In addition, we find  that the pitch and tilt angle of the helix structure can also be  adjusted by changing the strength and oscillation period of the applied  alternating external field. This may provide a feasible route for the  regulation of chiral liquid crystal phases by an alternating external  field.
