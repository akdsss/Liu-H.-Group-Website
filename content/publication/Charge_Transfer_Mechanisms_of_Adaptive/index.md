abstract: Charge-transfer mechanisms in adaptive multicomponent  solutions at liquid–solid interfaces with triboelectric probes are  crucial for understanding chemistry dynamics. However, liquid–solid  charge transfer becomes unpredictable, due to the components or  interactions in solutions, restricting its potential application for  precise monitoring of liquid environments. This study utilizes  triboelectric probes to investigate the charge transfer of chemicals,  applying this approach to real-time coolant state monitoring. Analysis  of electrical signal dynamics induced by ethylene glycol and its  oxidation byproduct, oxalic acid, in ethylene glycol solutions reveals  that hydrogen bond and ion adsorption diminishes the efficiency of  electron transfer at the liquid–solid interface. These findings promote  the engineering of the triboelectric probe that enhances coolant quality  with remarkable sensitivity (detection limit: 0.0001%) and a broad  freezing point operational range (0 to −49 °C). This work advances the  precise control of the charge dynamics and demonstrates the potential of  triboelectric probes for interdisciplinary applications.
