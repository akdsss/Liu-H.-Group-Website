abstract: We study living polymerization initiated from concave  surfaces. We clarify that, depending on different criteria for ceasing  the reaction, different relationships between grafted chain  polydispersity index and the grafting surface curvature can be  categorized. The average molecular weight of the grafted chains  monotonically decreases as the grafting surface curvature increases.  These results shed light on better control and design of functional  porous materials for use in bioimplanting or chemical sensors.
