We perform dynamics simulations to investigate the  translational and rotational glassy dynamics in a glass-forming liquid  of monodisperse soft Janus particles. We find that, with decreasing  temperature, the mean-square angular displacement shows no clear plateau  in the caging region, in contrast with the apparent caging behavior of  translational motion. By defining a reorientational mean-square angular  displacement, the caging behavior of rotational motion can be  recognized. On approaching the glass transition (decreasing  temperature), the coupling between translational and rotational  relaxation increases, while the coupling between translational and  rotational diffusion decreases, whereas the coupling between  translational and reorientational diffusion increases. The strong  decoupling between translational and rotational diffusion is due to the  suppressed translational mobility but promoted rotational mobility of  soft Janus particles. We think that the low-T SE and SED decoupling is  mainly attributed to hopping motion of soft Janus particles, whereas the  high-T SE and SED decoupling is mainly attributed to collective cage  motion of soft Janus particles. Our results demonstrate that interaction  anisotropy has a critical effect on the translational and rotational  dynamics of soft Janus particles."
