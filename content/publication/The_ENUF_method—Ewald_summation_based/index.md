Computer simulations of model systems are widely used to  explore striking phenomena in promising applications spanning from  physics, chemistry, biology, to materials science and engineering. The  long range electrostatic interactions between charged particles  constitute a prominent factor in determining structures and states of  model systems. How to efficiently calculate electrostatic interactions  in simulation systems subjected to partial or full periodic boundary  conditions has been a grand challenging task. In the past decades, a  large variety of computational schemes has been proposed, among which  the Ewald summation method is the most reliable route to accurately deal  with electrostatic interactions between charged particles in simulation  systems. In addition, extensive efforts have been done to improve  computational efficiencies of the Ewald summation based methods.  Representative examples are approaches based on cutoffs, reaction  fields, multi‐poles, multi‐grids, and particle‐mesh schemes. We sketched  an ENUF method, an abbreviation for the Ewald summation method based on  the nonuniform fast Fourier transform technique, and have implemented  this method in particle‐based simulation packages to calculate  electrostatic energies and forces at micro‐ and mesoscopic levels.  Extensive computational studies of conformational properties of  polyelectrolytes, dendrimer‐membrane complexes, and ionic fluids  demonstrated that the ENUF method and its derivatives conserve both  energy and momentum to floating point accuracy, and exhibit a  computational complexity of                              with optimal physical parameters. These ENUF based methods  are attractive alternatives in molecular simulations where high  accuracy and efficiency of simulation methods are needed to accelerate  calculations of electrostatic interactions at extended spatiotemporal  scales."
