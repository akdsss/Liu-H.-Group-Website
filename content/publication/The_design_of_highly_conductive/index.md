Highly conductive and stretchable polymer conductors  fabricated from conductive fillers and stretchable polymers are urgently  needed in flexible electronics, implants, soft robotics, etc. However,  polymer conductors encounter the conductivity-stretchability dilemma, in  which high-load fillers needed for high conductivity always result in  the stiffness of materials. Herein, we propose a new design of highly  conductive and stretchable polymer conductors with low-load  nanoparticles (NPs). The design is achieved by the self-assembly of  surface-modified NPs to efficiently form robust conductive pathways. We  employ computer simulations to elucidate the self-assembly of the NPs in  the polymer matrices under equilibrium and tensile states. The  conductive pathways retain 100% percolation probability even though the  loading of the NPs is lowered to ∼2% volume. When the tensile strain  reaches 400%, the percolation probability of the ∼2% NP system is still  greater than 25%. The theoretical prediction suggests a way for  advancing flexible conductive materials."
