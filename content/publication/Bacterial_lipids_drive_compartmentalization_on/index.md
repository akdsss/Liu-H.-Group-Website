abstract: "The design of cellular functions in synthetic systems,  inspired by the internal partitioning of living cells, is a constantly  growing research field that is paving the way to a large number of new  remarkable applications. Several hierarchies of internal compartments  like polymersomes, liposomes, and membranes are used to control the  transport, release, and chemistry of encapsulated species. However, the  experimental characterization and the comprehension of glycolipid  mesostructures are far from being fully addressed. Lipid A is indeed a  glycolipid and the endotoxic part of Gram-negative bacterial  lipopolysaccharide; it is the moiety that is recognized by the  eukaryotic receptors giving rise to the modulation of innate immunity.  Herein we propose, for the first time, a combined approach based on  hybrid Particle-Field (hPF) Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and  Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments to gain a molecular  picture of the complex supramolecular structures of lipopolysaccharide  (LPS) and lipid A at low hydration levels. The mutual support of data  from simulations and experiments allowed the unprecedented discovery of  the presence of a nano-compartmentalized phase composed of liposomes of  variable size and shape which can be used in synthetic biological  applications."
