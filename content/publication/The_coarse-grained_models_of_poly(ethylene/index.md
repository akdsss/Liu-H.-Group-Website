abstract: Polyethylene oxide (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO),  especially their tri-block copolymers PEO–PPO–PEO (poloxamers), have a  broad range of applications in biotechnology and medical science.  Understanding their specific interactions with biomembranes is the key  to unveil the unique features of poloxamers either as membrane-healing  or membrane pore-forming agents. Based on the coarse-graining convention  of the MARTINI force field and the big multipole water (BMW) model,  which has a three charged site topology and can reproduce the correct  dipole moment of four-water clusters, we generated coarse-grained (CG)  models with analytical and numerical potentials for PEO and PPO  homopolymers and poloxamers in dilute solution. The effective bonded  interaction potentials between CG beads were determined from the  probability distributions of bond lengths, angles and dihedrals that are  determined from atomistic simulations. The nonbonded interaction  parameters were fine-tuned to reproduce the conformational properties of  atomistic PEO and PPO homopolymers and poloxamers via extensive CG  simulations of PEO and PPO homopolymers and poloxamers in a BMW water  environment. The reported CG models provide a promising framework for a  comprehensive understanding of the microstructural, conformational, and  dynamic properties of poloxamers and their delicate interactions with  other species in an explicit water environment.
