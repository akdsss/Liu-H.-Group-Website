abstract: Nafion, as the mostly used proton exchange membrane material  in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), encounters serious vanadium  permeation problems due to the large size difference between its anionic  nanophase (3–5 nm) and cationic vanadium ions (∼0.6 nm). Bulk  hybridization usually suppresses the vanadium permeation at the expense  of proton conductivity since conventional additives tend to randomly  agglomerate and damage the nanophase continuity from unsuitable sizes  and intrinsic incompatibility. Here, we report the ionic-nanophase  hybridization strategy of Nafion membranes by using fluorinated block  copolymers (FBCs) and polyoxometalates (POMs) as supramolecular patching  additives. The cooperative noncovalent interactions among Nafion,  interfacial-active FBCs, and POMs can construct a 1 nm-shrunk ionic  nanophase with abundant proton transport sites, preserved continuity,  and efficient vanadium screeners, which leads to a comprehensive  enhancement in proton conductivity, selectivity, and VRFB performance.  These results demonstrate the intriguing potential of the supramolecular  patching strategy in precisely tuning nanostructured electrolyte  membranes for improved performance.
