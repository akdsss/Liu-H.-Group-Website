abstract: Kinetic step-growth polymerization is studied by dissipative  particle dynamics coupled with our previously developed reaction  algorithm on a coarse-grained level. The simulation result proves that  this step-growth polymerization obeys the second-order reaction  kinetics. We apply this algorithm to study the step-growth  polymerization using the subunits with different flexibilities or within  confinement. Good agreement of the number fraction distributions with  the Flory distribution is obtained, implying that this algorithm is  reasonable to describe such a kind of step-growth polymerization. This  algorithm can further supply a convenient platform for simulating  typical step-growth polymerization in reactive polymer systems.
