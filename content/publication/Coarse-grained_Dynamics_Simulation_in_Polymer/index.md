abstract: Polymers are widely used in our daily life and industry  because of their intrinsic characteristics, such as multi-functionality,  low cost, light mass, ease of processability, and excellent chemical  stability. Polymers have multiscale space-time properties, which are  mainly reflected in the fact that the properties of polymer systems  depend not only on chemical structure and molecular properties, but also  to a large extent on the aggregation state of molecules, that is, phase  structure and condensed state structure. Thanks to the continuous  development of simulation methods and the rapid improvement of  scientific computation, computer simulation has played an increasingly  important role in investigating the structure and properties of polymer  systems. Among them, coarse-grained dynamics simulations provide a  powerful tool for studying the self-assembly structure and dynamic  behavior of polymers, such as glass transition and entanglement  dynamics. This review summarizes the coarse-grained models and methods  in the dynamic simulations for polymers and their composite systems  based on graphics processing unit(GPU) algorithms, and discusses the  characteristics, applications, and advantages of different simulation  methods. Based on recent studies in our group, the main progress of  coarse-grained simulation methods in studying the structure, properties  and physical mechanism of polymer materials is reviewed. It is  anticipated to provide a reference for further development of  coarse-grained simulation methods and software suitable for polymer  research.
