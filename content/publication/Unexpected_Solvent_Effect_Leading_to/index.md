abstract: In athermal all-polymer nanocomposites (all-PNCs),  single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are often considered to be well  miscible with polymer matrixes due to their similarity in chemical  compositions. However, internal cross-linking units of SCNPs must have  different chemistries from the backbone monomers and, therefore, also  from matrix chains. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics  simulations to study the influence of solvent selectivity, particularly  to internal cross-linkers in SCNPs, on dispersion state of SCNPs in  all-PNC films upon solvent evaporation. Surprisingly, we find distinct  dispersion states of SCNPs in drying films with different solvent  selectivities. When the solvent is both good for cross-linkers and  backbone/matrix monomers, SCNPs can be uniformly dispersed. However,  when the backbone/matrix monomers have better solvophilicity than the  cross-linkers and the solvophilicity of the latter is weak enough, we  find segregation of SCNPs in surface regions. Such phenomena can be  attributed to the intrinsic difference in the solvent density at an  interface region from that in the bulk, which eventually results in the  aggregation of SCNPs at the interface region where the solvent particles  are much less than in the bulk. At the interface region, cross-linkers  in the SCNPs will have less contact with the solvent and, therefore,  less enthalpy penalty than being located in the bulk region of the film.  The results demonstrate that solvent selectivity has a non-negligible  effect on the structure of the composite film, which will inevitably  have impacts on macroscopic properties of the film.
