abstract: "It remains extremely challenging to build three-dimensional  photonic crystals with complete photonic bandgaps by simple and  experimentally realizable colloidal building blocks. Here, we  demonstrate that particle softness can enhance both the self-assembly of  pyrochlore- and perovskite-like lattice structures from simple  deformable triblock Janus colloids and their photonic bandgap  performances. Dynamics simulation results show that the region of  stability of pyrochlore lattices can be greatly expanded by  appropriately increasing softness, and the perovskite lattices are  unexpectedly obtained at enough high softness. Photonic calculations  show that the direct pyrochlore lattices formed from overlapping soft  triblock Janus particles exhibit even larger photonic bandgaps than the  ideal nonoverlapping pyrochlore lattice, and proper overlap arising from  softness can also dramatically improve the photonic properties of the  inverse pyrochlore and perovskite lattices. Our study offers a new and  feasible self-assembly path toward three-dimensional photonic crystals  with large and robust photonic bandgaps."
