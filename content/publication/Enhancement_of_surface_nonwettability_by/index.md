abstract: We present a computer simulation study on the nonwettability  of a flat surface tethered with deformable looped polymer chains. Two  kinds of loops are studied:monodispersed loops (loops with the same  length) and polydispersed loops (loops with different lengths). Both  kinds of loops include two arrangements:with regularly tethered sites  and with randomly tethered sites. Regularly grafted loops form typical  grooves on the surface, while randomly grafted loops form a more rugged  surface. For monodispersed loops, we analyze the factors that influence  the nonwettability when varying the rigidity of the loops. The loops are  divided into two categories based on their rigidity according to our  previous analysis procedure (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2016, 18,  18767–18775):rigid loops and flexible loops. It is found that the loop  can partially form a re-entrant-like structure, which is helpful to  increase the nonwettability of the surface. The surfaces with grafted  loops have increased nonwettability, especially those grafted with  flexible chains. However, the contact angle on the loop structure cannot  further increase for the rigid chains due to a large top layer density  (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2016, 18, 18767–18775). For polydispersed  loops, the contact angle is highly related to the rigidity of the long  loops that contact the droplet. Different from monodispersed loops, the  mechanism of the nonwettability of polydispersed loops is attributed to  the supporting ability (rigidity) of long loops.
