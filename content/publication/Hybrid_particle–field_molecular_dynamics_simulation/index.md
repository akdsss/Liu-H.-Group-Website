abstract: To achieve simulations on large spatial and temporal scales  with high molecular chemical specificity, a hybrid particle–field method  was proposed recently. This method is developed by combining molecular  dynamics and self-consistent field theory (MD-SCF). The MD-SCF method  has been validated by successfully predicting the experimentally  observable properties of several systems. Here we propose an efficient  scheme for the inclusion of electrostatic interactions in the MD-SCF  framework. In this scheme, charged molecules are interacting with the  external fields that are self-consistently determined from the charge  densities. This method is validated by comparing the structural  properties of polyelectrolytes in solution obtained from the MD-SCF and  particle-based simulations. Moreover, taking PMMA-b-PEO and LiCF3SO3 as  examples, the enhancement of immiscibility between the ion-dissolving  block and the inert block by doping lithium salts into the copolymer is  examined by using the MD-SCF method. By employing GPU-acceleration, the  high performance of the MD-SCF method with explicit treatment of  electrostatics facilitates the simulation study of many problems  involving polyelectrolytes.
