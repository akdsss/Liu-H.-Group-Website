Confined liquid crystals (LCs) exhibit complex and intriguing  structures, which are fascinating fundamental problems in soft matter.  The helical structure of cylindrical cavities is of great importance in  LC studies, particularly for their application in optical devices. In  this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to explore the  behavior of achiral smectic-B LCs confined in narrow cylindrical  cavities, where geometric frustration plays an important role. By  increasing the cylinder size, LCs exhibit a transition from  multi-helical to layered structures. Notably, we observe two stable  structures, namely the helical structure and the layered structure, at  moderate cylinder size. We also investigate the effects of the  arrangement of cylindrical wall particles (hexagonal or square array)  and anchoring strength on the LC structure. Our findings reveal that  both the hexagonal array and strong anchoring strength promote the  formation of helical structures. Our study provides novel insights into  the confinement physics of LCs and highlights the potential for  achieving helical structures in achiral LCs, which will expand the  future applications of LCs."
