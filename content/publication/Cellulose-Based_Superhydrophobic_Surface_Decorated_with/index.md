abstract: Inspired by the distinct functions of desert beetles with  efficient droplet nucleation and lotus leaves with excellent droplet  removal, an integrated method is presented for the design of a  superhydrophobic surface decorated with hydrophilic groups that can  efficiently nucleate and remove water droplets. We constructed a  cellulose-based superhydrophobic surface containing numerous olefin  terminal groups by solvent exchange and spray coating. This surface is  different from most of the reported biomimicking water harvesting  surfaces that rely on complicated lithography and micropatterning  techniques requiring special instruments. The obtained superhydrophobic  surface was further modified using various thiol compounds via a  thiol–ene reaction to manipulate the water harvesting property. The  modified surfaces containing hydrophobic groups (e.g., 1-octadecanethiol  and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol) or a strong hydrophilic group  (e.g., 3-mercaptopropionic acid and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol) exhibited  insufficient fog collecting abilities due to poor water droplet  nucleation or strong water adhesion. By contrast, the modified surface  decorated with moderately hydrophilic amino groups combines the  advantages of biological surfaces with distinct wetting features (such  as fog-harvesting beetles and water-repellent lotus leaves), resulting  in accelerated water nucleation and less compromise of the water removal  efficiency. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the efficient  droplet nucleation is attributed to the hydrophilic amino groups whereas  the rapid droplet removal is due to the maintained superhydrophobicity  of the amino group-modified surface. This strategy of decorating a  superhydrophobic surface with moderately hydrophilic functional groups  provides insight into the manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal  for water collection efficiency.
