abstract: In this work, by using coarse-grained molecular dynamics  simulations, we found that poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl  phosphorylcholine)(PMPC) showed a strong solubility and a so-called  antipolyelectrolyte effect(APE) in water. In contrast, obvious  aggregations but no APE were found in n-butyl-substituted choline  phosphate polymers(PMBP) solutions. The underlying mechanisms for  different solution behaviors of PMPC and PMBP were investigated in  detail. Our results indicate that the presence of butyl groups in PMBP  enhances both the electrostatic interactions and the hydrophobicity of  PMBP molecules in the system. Both factors were found to contribute to  the formations of aggregates in the PMBP system. Further researches  revealed that hydrophobicity arising from the butyl group plays a more  important role than electrostatic interactions in inducing the PMBP  aggregation. In addition, the strong hydrophobicity in PMBP was found to  be responsible for the absence of APE. These results are expected to  contribute to a better understanding and a better design of the solution  properties of polyzwitt erions.
