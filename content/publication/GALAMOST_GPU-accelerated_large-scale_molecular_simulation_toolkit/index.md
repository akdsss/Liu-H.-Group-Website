abstract: "GALAMOST [graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated  large-scale molecular simulation toolkit] is a molecular simulation  package designed to utilize the computational power of GPUs. Besides the  common features of molecular dynamics (MD) packages, it is developed  specially for the studies of self-assembly, phase transition, and other  properties of polymeric systems at mesoscopic scale by using some lately  developed simulation techniques. To accelerate the simulations,  GALAMOST contains a hybrid particle-field MD technique where  particle–particle interactions are replaced by interactions of particles  with density fields. Moreover, the numerical potential obtained by  bottom-up coarse-graining methods can be implemented in simulations with  GALAMOST. By combining these force fields and particle-density coupling  method in GALAMOST, the simulations for polymers can be performed with  very large system sizes over long simulation time. In addition, GALAMOST  encompasses two specific models, that is, a soft anisotropic particle  model and a chain-growth polymerization model, by which the hierarchical  self-assembly of soft anisotropic particles and the problems related to  polymerization can be studied, respectively. The optimized algorithms  implemented on the GPU, package characteristics, and benchmarks of  GALAMOST are reported in detail. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
