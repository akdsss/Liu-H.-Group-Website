Self-assembly in nature is fundamentally dynamic, existing in  out-of-equilibrium state in which the systems have the ability to  autonomously respond to environmental changes. However, artificial  systems exist in a global minimum state, which are incapable of  conducting such complex functions. Here we report that input of thermal  energy can trigger fixed, artificial toroids to spontaneously nucleate  helical growth. The helical polymerization undergoes reversible and  repeatable cycles with subsequent energy input. When the toroids are  located inside lipid vesicles, the polymerization-depolymerization cycle  is accompanied by reversible elongation of spherical vesicles. Such  liberation from a global minimum state will pave the way to create  emergent structures with functions as complex as those of living  systems."
