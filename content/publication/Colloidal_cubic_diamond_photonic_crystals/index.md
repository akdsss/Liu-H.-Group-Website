abstract: Colloidal cubic diamond crystals with low-coordinated and  staggered structures could display a wide photonic bandgap at low  refractive index contrasts, which makes them extremely valuable for  photonic applications. However, self-assembly of cubic diamond crystals  using simple colloidal building blocks is still considerably  challenging, due to their low packing fraction and mechanical  instability. Here we propose a new strategy for constructing colloidal  cubic diamond crystals through cooperative self-assembly of  surface-anisotropic triblock Janus colloids and isotropic colloidal  spheres into superlattices. In self-assembly, cooperativity is achieved  by tuning the interaction and particle size ratio of colloidal building  blocks. The pyrochlore lattice formed by self-assembly of triblock Janus  colloids acts as a soft template to direct the packing of colloidal  spheres into cubic diamond lattices. Numerical simulations show that  this cooperative self-assembly strategy works well in a large range of  particle size ratio of these two species. Moreover, photonic band  structure calculations reveal that the resulting cubic diamond lattices  exhibit wide and complete photonic bandgaps and the width and frequency  of the bandgaps can also be easily adjusted by tuning the particle size  ratio. Our work will open up a promising avenue toward photonic bandgap  materials by cooperative self-assembly employing surface-anisotropic  Janus or patchy colloids as a soft template.
