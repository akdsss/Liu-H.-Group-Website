abstract: The mechanism of growth of one of the competitive topologies  for covalent organic frameworks with constitutional isomers is poorly  understood. Herein, we employ molecular dynamics to study the  isoenergetic assembly of the rhombic square (sql) and Kagome lattice  (kgm). The concentration, solvent conditions, and the reversibility of  chemical reactions are considered by means of an Arrhenius two-state  model to describe the reactions. High concentrations and poor solvent  both result in sql, agreeing well with recent experiments. Moreover, the  high reversibility of reactions gives rise to sql, while the low  reversibility leads to kgm, suggesting a new way of regulating the  topology. Our analyses support that the nucleation of isomers influenced  by experimental conditions is responsible for the selection of  topologies, which improves understanding of the control of topology. We  also propose a strategy in which a two-step growth can be exploited to  greatly improve the crystallinity of kgm.
